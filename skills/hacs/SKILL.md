# HA NOVA HACS Lifecycle

## Scope

HACS package lifecycle:
- inventory: registered repositories, installed versions, pending states
- custom repository registration and removal
- download/install (exact version, stable, or explicit prerelease), update,
  redownload, version pinning
- uninstall/removal with consumer discovery
- custom-integration migration coordination

Not in scope:
- `update.*` entity flows — the plain "update this integration" path stays in
  `ha-nova:updates`; this skill owns what the entity flow cannot do
- integration config flows after install (`ha-nova:integration-setup`)
- installing HACS itself (HA documentation/UI)
- Lovelace dashboard editing (`ha-nova:dashboard`)

## Bootstrap (once per session)

Read and follow `../ha-nova/session-bootstrap.md`.
Verify relay CLI: `ha-nova relay health`
If this fails: `ha-nova setup`

Then probe HACS once via `hacs/info` and classify the failure before
advertising any coverage: WS error `unauthorized` → the Relay upstream
credential lacks HA admin (HACS registers every command admin-only) —
remediation is switching that credential to an admin account, never an
install hint. `unknown_command` is ambiguous (missing, not loaded, or an
unsupported line that does not register the pinned commands): read the HACS
config entry via the API — entry absent → install guidance; entry present
but `not_loaded`/`setup_error`/`setup_retry`/`migration_error` →
load/restart/repair remediation; entry present and loaded → unsupported
schema, fail closed with the HACS-UI pointer.

## Relay Contract

File-based relay requests only:
- `ha-nova relay ws --data-file <payload-file> --out <result-file>` — all
  `hacs/*` commands, the WS-only frontend reads
  `{"type":"lovelace/resources"}` and
  `{"type":"lovelace/config","url_path":<dashboard>}`, and the preflight
  reads the uninstall/migration flow depends on:
  `{"type":"config_entries/get"}`,
  `{"type":"config/entity_registry/list"}`,
  `{"type":"config/device_registry/list"}`, and
  `{"type":"search/related","item_type":"entity","item_id":<entity_id>}`
- `ha-nova relay core --method GET --path <path> --out <result-file>` for HA
  REST reads (config entries, states)
- `ha-nova relay core --method DELETE --path /api/config/config_entries/entry/<entry_id>`
  — ONLY for a dependent config-entry deletion inside this skill's
  uninstall/migration flow, after its own typed confirmation
- `--jq-file <filter-file>` for non-trivial filters

Envelope parsing follows `skills/ha-nova/relay-api.md` → Standard Envelope;
WS results live under `.data`.

The pinned command map, repository-identity rules, error asymmetry, and
restart semantics live in `hacs-commands.md` — read it before the first
`hacs/*` call. Only commands from that map may be sent. Read `hacs/info`
first every session and apply its capability gate; on an unrecognized schema
or a set `disabled_reason`, fail closed with the HACS-UI pointer on an
unrecognized install. Never guess schemas, never edit `.storage`, never SSH.

## Flow

### Inventory

1. Capability gate (`hacs/info`), then `hacs/repositories/list` — bounded:
   filter by requested category/name, render as a List Frame with counts and
   Progressive Detail; never dump the raw list.
2. Registration, downloaded files, and config entries are three distinct
   lifecycle objects — name them as such in every result (a registered
   repository is not installed; installed files are not a configured
   integration).
3. Surface `hacs/repositories/removed` matches and unacknowledged
   `hacs/critical/list` entries for installed packages as warnings.

### Resolve

Resolve the target through `list`/`hacs/repository/info` in THIS session and
use only its `id` afterwards (identity rules in `hacs-commands.md`). On
ambiguity, ask one blocking question with the candidate `full_name`s. Never
act on a name match alone.

### Install / update / redownload / pin

1. Read `hacs/repository/releases` (and `release_notes` for updates) before
   choosing. The list is DISCOVERY, not the complete chooser — it returns
   only the newest page (~30): a user-named tag/ref outside it can still
   be installed one-off; bind that exact ref in the preview and let the
   download validate it (a rejected ref fails the mutation loudly, which
   the read-back confirms). Durable-pin rules (2.0.5 `version_to_download`): on a repository WITH
   releases, any non-null `selected_tag` is honored — older tags outside
   the newest page pin durably (confirm with the post-pin read-back that
   `selected_tag` is still set); pinning the CURRENT latest clears itself
   (HACS resets it) and is not a pin. On a repository WITHOUT releases,
   only the default branch pins durably — any other ref installs one-off
   with the default-branch fallback named in the preview. A PRERELEASE tag on a repository that ALSO has a stable release pins
   durably without any toggle (`last_version` is set). Only a
   prerelease-ONLY repository needs beta visibility ON for a durable
   prerelease pin (the confirmed `hacs/repository/beta` toggle): with it
   off, such a repository has no `last_version` and its prereleases are
   absent from `published_tags`, so later downloads fall back to the
   default branch — without the toggle, that install is one-off, named
   as such. A repository with NO releases installs its
   default branch — first-class, not unsupported: name the branch and
   resolved commit in the preview and verify the installed ref on
   read-back. A user-pinned version (`selected_tag`) is never silently
   replaced by a newer release — say the pin exists and ask; prerelease only
   on explicit request — choose the tag from `releases` (its `prerelease`
   flag marks them; no visibility toggle needed to install one). The
   `hacs/repository/beta` toggle is itself a mutation: send it only after
   the confirmed preview, when the user wants prereleases to STAY visible.
2. Preview per the Preview Card: repository `full_name`, category,
   installed → target version, HA domain (from the list row —
   `repository/info` is needed only for release/pin state and clears the
   repository's `new` flag — name that side effect),
   restart/reload impact, and — for updates — the release-notes summary
   with breaking changes. Natural
   confirmation for install/update/redownload binds to this exact preview.
3. Apply: `hacs/repository/download` with the chosen `version` — never
   version-then-download (a version-less download resolves to LATEST, and
   every download clears the selection; see `hacs-commands.md`). Branch-only
   repositories (`releases` empty, `version_or_commit` = `commit`) are the
   one case WITHOUT a `version`: preview the default-branch install, send
   `download` without `version`, and verify against the commit-ish
   `installed_version` — pinning and downgrades are unavailable there; say
   so instead of blocking the install. A Relay
   timeout is an UNKNOWN outcome — enter the reconcile loop below; never
   fire a second download on a timeout. For a persistent pin, send
   `hacs/repository/version` AFTER the verified download and disclose that
   HACS keeps flagging the repository `pending_upgrade`.
4. Verify category-appropriately (Verification below) and report INSTALLED
   vs ACTIVE honestly.

### Custom repositories

- Add: validate the GitHub reference AND resolve the repository category —
  `add` requires it: derive it from repository evidence (manifest, topics,
  structure), ask the user when ambiguous, and bind the chosen category in
  the preview; never guess silently. Then `hacs/repositories/add`. The
  socket reports success EVEN ON FAILURE — verify by re-listing for the
  canonical `full_name`; missing after the re-read means the add failed
  (duplicate/rename detection happens on the same re-read). Registration
  does not download anything; say so.
- Remove registration: typed confirmation code, and only with exact identity
  plus installation state known — and only when `installed == false`.
  Unregistering an installed repository strands its files (the ID vanishes
  from `list`, so a later uninstall would need re-registration): when it is
  still installed, run the separately confirmed uninstall FIRST, then
  unregister. Removing a registration never deletes files.

### Uninstall / removal

EVERY uninstall/removal — standalone or inside a migration — runs
HACS-specific consumer discovery FIRST and shows the result in the preview:
- the integration's OWN footprint through the HA registries: entities whose
  registry `platform` equals the integration's domain (this also covers
  YAML-configured setups that have NO config entry), config entries of that
  domain (`config_entries/get`) with their devices, plus a bounded
  `/api/states` scan for the domain's entities missing from the registry.
  When none of these sources yields the footprint, the preview says the
  footprint is incomplete — never that there is none
- REFERENCING automations/scripts/scenes through `search/related` on those
  entities — read the response ONLY through the canonical filter
  `skills/ha-nova/search-related-consumers.jq` (recreate it per
  `skills/ha-nova/relay-api.md` → Parsing rule on flat-copy installs). Fail
  closed: only a verified-shape empty result means "no linked consumers
  found"; a failed, skipped, or wrong-path scan renders as "consumer check
  inconclusive", NEVER as a no-consumer claim. The canonical filter covers
  exactly those three referencer arrays — helpers and other referencer
  kinds are disclosed as unscanned
- for frontend packages additionally the Lovelace resource list and storage
  dashboard configs for the package's custom element references; manual YAML
  dashboards and template consumers are not enumerable — name them as an
  unscanned surface, never claim "no consumers"
Then the Delete Card with the typed `confirm:<token>`. On confirmation
APPLY the uninstall — `hacs/repository/remove` (deletes the downloaded
files) — and read back until `installed == false` in the repository info
(reconcile loop on timeout); only that read-back is success. Dependent
config-entry deletion carries its own typed confirmation. For
non-config-flow integrations the running component stays loaded until the
HA restart — report removed-but-still-loaded and offer the restart as its
own confirmed step. Record pre-change state (versions, repository
identity) in the result so reinstalling the previous version stays
explainable.

### Migration (custom integration replaces another)

A CURRENT completed full Home
Assistant Backup is MANDATORY before the first destructive step — create
one via `ha-nova:backup`, or accept an existing backup only when it is
COMPLETED and CURRENT (a backup predating the present configuration does
not satisfy the gate; config entries sit outside config snapshots — the
Backup is the recovery net).
Check same-domain replacement risk before installing the replacement: a
fork that keeps the original integration domain collides with the
installed one — name which registration/entry survives and in what order.
Never delete a working config entry before the replacement is resolvable;
hand config flows to `ha-nova:integration-setup`; hard stop for UI-only
credentials/OAuth/pairing; entity-ID preservation is verified, never
promised; cleanup of the old package is delayed until verification passes.

### Reconcile loop (timeouts and unknown outcomes)

A Relay timeout or generic error is an UNKNOWN outcome, never a failure:
re-read HACS repository state, HA config entries, and pending flows over a
bounded settle window (up to three reads across ~30 seconds) until the
outcome is proven completed/failed/still-running. A single unchanged
read-back proves nothing — the upstream operation may still land later.
Non-idempotent mutations NEVER auto-retry; only an idempotent mutation
(repeating it is harmless even if the original lands later) may retry, and
only after re-reading identity before every retry. Everything else stops
with the observed state and asks the user.

### Verification

Command success alone is never a result. Verify by category:
- integration: repository `installed`/`installed_version`, manifest/domain
  presence, config-entry state — distinguishing INSTALLED (files updated)
  from ACTIVE (running component). Every integration upgrade requires a
  Home Assistant restart before the new version is live: report "installed,
  not yet active", surface the pending-restart status/repair, and offer the
  restart as a separate confirmed step via `ha-nova:service-call` — never
  restart silently, never claim the new version is live before it.
- frontend/plugin: repository state and installed version; in storage
  resource mode also the Lovelace resource registration — in YAML mode the
  resource is user-managed: say so instead of failing the check. A
  frontend reload note replaces restart talk.
- theme: repository state and version (no integration manifest exists).
- python_script: repository state and version, PLUS the real activation
  anchor — after the user-confirmed reload, the `python_script.<name>`
  service exists in the service registry; before that reload, report
  installed-but-not-active.
- template/appdaemon: repository state and version are the ONLY
  Relay-verifiable evidence (no config entry, no Lovelace resource, no
  readable files; appdaemon runs outside HA). Run the lifecycle, but NEVER
  report these as activation-verified: name the limit and point to the
  HACS UI / AppDaemon's own logs for activation proof.
Also verify survival of unrelated objects and absence of duplicates after
adds/migrations. Evidence comes from the HACS/HA APIs ONLY — never file
reads; the Relay file endpoint denies `custom_components` and `www` by
design.

## Error Handling

Apply the error asymmetry from `hacs-commands.md`: clean
`repository_not_found` only from `info`/`ignore`; `download` errors with
code `error`; most bad-ID paths return a generic error — treat any generic
error as an unknown outcome (reconcile loop), not as proof of failure, and
re-resolve the ID before anything else. Never surface raw envelopes; report
the operation, the observed state, and the next safe step.

## Output Format

Apply `skills/ha-nova/output-rules.md` to all user-facing output: List Frame
for inventories (counts first, Progressive Detail follow-ups), Preview/Delete
/Result Cards for mutations, no raw JSON. Keep repository `full_name`,
versions, categories, and HA state values literal; localize everything else
at runtime.

## Safety

- Preview before write: nothing is saved until the user confirms the shown preview.
- Confirmation binds to the displayed preview and expires on any change to target, payload, endpoint, or scope (context skill → Active Preview Confirmation).
- Pre-preview phrases ("do it", "go ahead", "implement the plan") authorize drafting and preview only — never the write itself.
- Delete and destructive operations require the typed confirmation code `confirm:<token>` verbatim; "yes" or any natural-language reply is invalid.
- Never guess entity, service, or config IDs — resolve them or ask.
- Home Assistant is reached exclusively through `ha-nova relay`.
- For any HA write this skill does not cover, STOP and invoke `ha-nova:fallback` first — never probe unfamiliar write endpoints.

- Drafts follow `skills/ha-nova/smallest-solution.md`: the complete requested outcome in the simplest safe design, nothing for hypothetical future needs.

- Confirmation tiers: natural confirmation for install/update/redownload;
  the typed confirmation code for uninstall, registration removal, and
  dependent config-entry deletion.
- The migration backup gate is non-negotiable: no destructive migration
  step before a COMPLETED and CURRENT full Home Assistant Backup exists.
- Never trigger restarts, reloads, or config flows silently — each is its
  own confirmed step in its owning skill.
- No credentials or GitHub secrets in chat or output, ever.
