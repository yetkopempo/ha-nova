## Action Flow Control

### choose vs if/then

| Branches | Use | Why |
|----------|-----|-----|
| 2 (binary) | `if/then/else` | Simpler, reads like prose |
| 3+ | `choose` with `default:` | Multiple branches; `default:` prevents silent no-op (R-09) |

```yaml
# if/then — binary decision
actions:
  - if:
      - condition: sun
        after: sunset
    then:
      - action: light.turn_on
        target: { entity_id: light.porch }
    else:
      - action: light.turn_off
        target: { entity_id: light.porch }
```

### wait_for_trigger vs delay

| Need | Use | Not |
|------|-----|-----|
| "Turn off after no motion for 3 min" | `wait_for_trigger` on motion off + `for:` | `delay: 180` (ignores re-triggers) |
| Fixed pause between steps | `delay:` | `wait_for_trigger` |
| Wait for a condition to become true | `wait_template` (passes immediately if already true) | `wait_for_trigger` (waits for *change*) |

Always add `timeout:` to both (R-04). With `mode: restart`, `wait_for_trigger` resets correctly on re-trigger.

```yaml
# Motion light — restart + wait_for_trigger (canonical pattern)
mode: restart
actions:
  - action: light.turn_on
    target: { entity_id: light.hallway }
  - wait_for_trigger:
      - trigger: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.motion_hallway
        to: "off"
        for: { minutes: 3 }
    timeout: { minutes: 10 }
  - action: light.turn_off
    target: { entity_id: light.hallway }
    data: { transition: 3 }
```

## Trigger Patterns

### Trigger IDs with choose

Use `id:` on triggers + `condition: trigger` in `choose:` branches (R-13, R-14):

```yaml
triggers:
  - trigger: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.motion
    to: "on"
    id: motion_on
  - trigger: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.motion
    to: "off"
    for: { minutes: 5 }
    id: motion_off
actions:
  - choose:
      - conditions: [{ condition: trigger, id: motion_on }]
        sequence:
          - action: light.turn_on
            target: { entity_id: light.hallway }
      - conditions: [{ condition: trigger, id: motion_off }]
        sequence:
          - action: light.turn_off
            target: { entity_id: light.hallway }
```

### Sun Trigger

```yaml
triggers:
  - trigger: sun
    event: sunset
    offset: "-00:30:00"   # 30 min before sunset
```

### Time Pattern Trigger

For sub-minute precision (P-04: template trigger with `now()` re-evaluates only once/min):

```yaml
triggers:
  - trigger: time_pattern
    minutes: "/5"   # every 5 minutes
```

## Native Conditions (prefer over templates)

For the full mapping of templates → native alternatives, see `template-guidelines.md` → Decision Tree.
Below are additive patterns not covered there.

### Numeric State with Duration

```yaml
conditions:
  - condition: numeric_state
    entity_id: sensor.temperature
    above: 25
    for: { minutes: 5 }
```

### State Condition with Attribute

```yaml
conditions:
  - condition: state
    entity_id: climate.thermostat
    attribute: hvac_action
    state: "heating"
```

## Targeting

### target: Structure (M-03)

```yaml
# Correct — use target: key
actions:
  - action: light.turn_on
    target:
      entity_id: light.main_light
    data:
      brightness_pct: 80

# Wrong — entity_id under data: (deprecated)
actions:
  - action: light.turn_on
    data:
      entity_id: light.main_light
      brightness_pct: 80
```

### Multiple Targets

```yaml
target:
  entity_id:
    - light.zone_a
    - light.zone_b
  area_id: area_alpha       # all lights in that area
```

### entity_id vs device_id

Prefer `entity_id` (stable, user-controllable). `device_id` changes on re-add.

Exception: Zigbee button/remote triggers — see `best-practices.md` → Zigbee Button Patterns.

## Response Variables

Some services return data. Capture with `response_variable`:

```yaml
actions:
  - action: weather.get_forecasts
    target: { entity_id: weather.home }
    data: { type: hourly }
    response_variable: forecast
  - action: notify.mobile_app_<device>   # resolve the real service (skills/notify) before saving
    data:
      message: "High: {{ forecast['weather.home'].forecast[0].temperature }}°C"
```

## Advanced Patterns

### Manual-Override Window

Suppress an automation for N minutes after manual control. A timer helper is the flag: it auto-expires and (with `restore: true`) survives restarts. An event-triggered automation's change carries a parent context, but a time-triggered automation runs with NONE — exclude the paired automation's own run by context id, since a manual change (physical or UI) also has no parent.

```yaml
# Automation 1 — start the override window on manual control
triggers:
  - trigger: state
    entity_id: light.hallway
actions:
  - if:
      - condition: template
        value_template: >
          {{ trigger.to_state.context.parent_id is none
             and trigger.to_state.context.id != states.automation.hallway_motion.context.id }}
    then:
      - action: timer.start
        target: { entity_id: timer.hallway_override }
        data: { duration: "00:30:00" }

# Automation 2 — the motion automation gates on the window
conditions:
  - condition: state
    entity_id: timer.hallway_override
    state: idle
```

### Rate-Limited Notification

Cooldown via a last-notified timestamp helper (`input_datetime` with date and time). Compare as timestamps to avoid naive/aware datetime subtraction errors; the `0` default makes a never-set helper pass the gate.

```yaml
conditions:
  - condition: template
    value_template: >
      {{ as_timestamp(now()) - as_timestamp(states('input_datetime.last_leak_alert'), 0) > 3600 }}
actions:
  - action: notify.mobile_app_<device>   # resolve the real service (skills/notify) before saving
    data: { message: "Leak detected!" }
  - action: input_datetime.set_datetime
    target: { entity_id: input_datetime.last_leak_alert }
    data: { timestamp: "{{ now().timestamp() }}" }
```

### Presence-Simulation Loop

Randomized-within-bounds schedule while away. `random` and `now()` are evaluated by Home Assistant at each run — never pre-render a random value into the stored config, that freezes one sample forever. `condition: sun` with `after: sunset` alone is false between midnight and sunrise (that day's sunset is still in the future) — pair it with `before: sunrise` or use a time window so the loop survives midnight.

```yaml
mode: single
triggers:
  - trigger: time_pattern
    minutes: "/30"
conditions:
  - condition: state
    entity_id: input_boolean.vacation_mode
    state: "on"
  - condition: sun
    after: sunset
    before: sunrise    # true across midnight; after: sunset alone dies at 00:00
actions:
  - delay:
      minutes: "{{ range(0, 25) | random }}"
  - action: light.toggle
    target: { entity_id: light.living_room }
```

### Stale-Sensor Watchdog

Alert when a sensor stops updating. Trigger on a `time_pattern` cadence and check the `last_reported` age in a condition (identical re-reports advance `last_reported` while `last_updated` stays — value-change age would false-alarm on steady sensors) — NOT via a `now()` template trigger, whose once-per-minute re-evaluation can mask the very stall it watches for (P-04). A flag helper makes it one alert per incident, not a storm; clear the flag when the sensor reports again.

```yaml
# Watchdog — alert once when readings stop
mode: single
triggers:
  - trigger: time_pattern
    minutes: "/15"
conditions:
  - condition: template
    value_template: >
      {% set s = states.sensor.greenhouse_temp | default(none) %}
      {{ s is none
         or (now() - (s.last_reported or s.last_updated)).total_seconds() > 3600 }}
  - condition: state
    entity_id: input_boolean.greenhouse_temp_stale
    state: "off"
actions:
  # notify FIRST: a failed notify with the flag already set would silence the
  # whole incident; the inverse failure only repeats an alert (visible, not silent)
  - action: notify.mobile_app_<device>   # resolve the real service (skills/notify) before saving
    data: { message: "Greenhouse sensor silent for over an hour" }
  - action: input_boolean.turn_on
    target: { entity_id: input_boolean.greenhouse_temp_stale }

# Recovery — only a VALID fresh REPORT clears the flag. Freshness keys on
# last_reported (identical re-reports advance it while last_updated stays);
# a state trigger would miss identical reports, so recovery polls too.
triggers:
  - trigger: time_pattern
    minutes: "/15"
conditions:
  - condition: template
    value_template: >
      {% set s = states.sensor.greenhouse_temp | default(none) %}
      {{ s is not none
         and (now() - (s.last_reported or s.last_updated)).total_seconds() < 3600
         and s.state not in ['unavailable', 'unknown'] }}
  - condition: state
    entity_id: input_boolean.greenhouse_temp_stale
    state: "on"
actions:
  - action: input_boolean.turn_off
    target: { entity_id: input_boolean.greenhouse_temp_stale }
```

### Native Adaptive Lighting

Re-apply computed brightness/color on a cadence — ONLY while no manual override window is active (pair with Manual-Override Window above) and only on lights already on. The automation never turns lights on and never fights a manual change.

```yaml
mode: single
triggers:
  - trigger: time_pattern
    minutes: "/10"
conditions:
  - condition: state
    entity_id: light.living_room
    state: "on"
  - condition: state
    entity_id: timer.living_room_override
    state: idle
actions:
  - action: light.turn_on
    target: { entity_id: light.living_room }
    data:
      # example curve: warm at the horizon, cooler as the sun climbs
      color_temp_kelvin: >
        {{ (2500 + 40 * [state_attr('sun.sun', 'elevation') | float(0), 0] | max) | round(0) }}
      transition: 5
```

### Replicate Across Rooms

"Do the same for the kitchen" after a verified create. Replication is
re-resolution, never copy-paste:

1. Resolve the TARGET room's own entities (and devices, for device-trigger
   roles) for every role the source
   automation uses (motion sensor, light, …) by EFFECTIVE area membership —
   an entity with an empty `area_id` inherits its device's area, so join the
   device registry (or use `search/related` on the area). Skip
   registry-disabled entities when resolving — a disabled counterpart counts
   as "no counterpart" (say so);
   a ROOM-BOUND role with no counterpart in that room stops the replication
   for that room with a plain sentence — never substitute a neighboring
   room's entity. Home-wide roles (`sun.sun`, zones, household presence,
   global mode helpers) have no per-room counterpart by design: carry them
   over unchanged. A source that embeds its room in a template, a group/label
   target (`light.living_room_group`, `label_id: ambient`), or a non-entity
   literal (`area_entities('living_room')`, area names inside Jinja) stops
   the replication unless that reference re-resolves to the target room —
   never string-replace room names.
2. Rebuild the config with the resolved entities; carry over timings,
   conditions, and mode; rename by room ("Motion light — kitchen").
   Capability-specific actions (color temperature, cover position, climate
   mode) AND capability-specific triggers (a device trigger's subtype such
   as a double-press) require the target to actually support them — verify
   actions via state attributes, device-trigger subtypes via the target
   device's trigger list (`device_automation/trigger/list`), and `event.*`
   entity triggers via the target entity's `event_types` attribute. A missing BEHAVIOR-CARRYING capability
   stops that room with a plain sentence (a silently simplified replica is
   not "the same"); only cosmetic attributes may be dropped, named in the
   preview.
3. Before each room's preview, run the duplicate check for THAT room
   (config evidence per `starter-proposals.md`'s gate — the offer may be
   stale, or the user may have asked directly without an offer); an already
   automated pairing stops that room with a plain sentence — a pairing
   found only in an automation that cannot fire (registry-disabled or
   state off) stops that room's write with the enable offer instead of a
   duplicate stop. A PARTIAL scan
   does not stop the room — name it in that room's preview.
4. One normal preview/confirm per room. Multiple rooms are sequential
   single writes, each individually verified — never one batch.
5. The offer side of this pattern is the Replication Line
   (`output-rules.md`): one evidence-gated closing sentence, only after a
   verified create, only when the registries prove the same pairing exists.

## One-Shot And Temporary Automations

A request that should not outlive its purpose — "tell me when the laundry
finishes", "run the sprinkler for 30 minutes" — follows
`skills/ha-nova/one-shot-automations.md`: self-disabling patterns, deadline
expiry with startup recovery, and duration requests where write owns both
halves.

## Save / Restore Patterns

- Save → modify → restore designs that must survive a restart: check `skills/ha-nova/best-practices.md` → Persistence Model before choosing the storage construct. `scene.create` snapshots and `variables:` do not survive restarts.
- Pair the forward (save) branch with a state flag and guard the reverse (restore) branch on that flag; clear the flag after restoring. An unguarded reverse branch overwrites user-set state after cycles where the forward branch never ran.
