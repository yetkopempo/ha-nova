# Home Assistant Doc Gate (Mandatory Before Planning)

Date: 2026-02-26

## Rule

Before any new implementation plan, review current official Home Assistant docs in three buckets:

1. Developer APIs (REST, WS, Auth, Supervisor)
2. Apps (formerly add-ons): configuration, communication, testing, security
3. User docs: automations/scripts/dashboard/common tasks

No plan starts before this gate is checked.

## Reviewed Sources (Official)

### 1) Developer + API

### 2) Apps / Add-ons

## Hard Findings For ha-nova

1. App options persist in `/data/options.json`; secrets placed there remain server-side, but normal App upstream auth does not need an LLAT option.
2. Supervisor proxy supports `http://supervisor/core/api` and `ws://supervisor/core/websocket` via `SUPERVISOR_TOKEN`.
3. Supervisor endpoint supports `/addons/<addon>/options` and `/addons/<addon>/options/validate`; `self` slug is supported for app-scoped calls.
4. LLAT remains valid for long-lived integration scenarios and is created in user profile.
5. Official local app testing baseline is devcontainer-based with Supervisor + Home Assistant.
6. Security guidance favors least-privilege roles, no host-network unless required, and ingress/auth best practices.
7. Revalidated 2026-07-17: `homeassistant_api: true` plus process-local `SUPERVISOR_TOKEN` is the official passwordless App path for both Core REST and WebSocket proxies. NOVA uses LLAT only for standalone Container/Core fallback.

## Planning Checklist (Must Pass)

- [ ] API transport choice mapped (REST vs WS vs Supervisor)
- [ ] Auth model mapped (`SUPERVISOR_TOKEN` vs LLAT) with fallback behavior
- [ ] App option schema impact checked (`config.yaml` options/schema)
- [ ] Local test path defined (unit + integration + local app testing)
- [ ] User-facing impact checked against user docs workflow
