# ── 1. LOC count ──
# The relay must stay small enough that a person can read it. The ceiling moved
# from 2000 to 2800 across relay 0.4.0 (opt-in file transport: containment,
# deny rules, code-execution boundary) and to 3200 across relay 0.5.0 (the
# generic config-snapshot store, ~330 lines of validation, caps and prune;
# and to 3300 for the diagnosability wave: disconnect reasons, request
# logging, server timeouts; and to 3700 for Wave 6's bounded pairing manager,
# persisted App credential, and code-authenticated transport endpoint; and to
# 3900 for Home Base's static status renderer and Supervisor ingress gate; and
# to 7000 for the secure device-pairing wave (relay 0.7): the OPAQUE (RFC 9807)
# server, a persistent self-signed TLS identity with SPKI pinning, durable
# atomic-file storage, the versioned fail-closed device registry, the pairing
# state machine, per-device auth, three listeners, legacy migration, and the
# NOVA owner console with CSRF-protected form actions including legacy-access
# revocation and corrupt-registry owner recovery; and to 9000 for the reviewed
# Cloud ingress/security wave: persistent Relay identity, HA-user-bound device
# credentials and revocation, ingress-only OPAQUE pairing v2, strict shared
# ingress identity and principal gates, bounded request bodies, atomic
# pairing-response persistence with replay protection, and cleanup-only routes
# while Cloud is disabled; and to 9200 for the #482 owner-console safety
# rework: the armed two-step confirm flow with device-bound CSRF tokens, the
# typed registry-reset gate, and throttled last-used tracking with disk-failure
# fallback in the device auth path. The current reviewed tree is about 9030
# lines; the 9200 ceiling leaves only narrow refactoring headroom and still
# fails further unreviewed Relay growth.
