# HA NOVA Scene

## Scope

Storage-scene lifecycle:
- list scenes with editability
- read scene configs
- create, update, delete storage scenes (what the HA editor stores in `scenes.yaml`)

Not in scope:
- activating scenes (`scene.turn_on`) — use `ha-nova:service-call`
- integration-owned scenes (Hue, deCONZ, ...) — see Editability Guard below
- `scene.create` runtime snapshots inside automations — owned by `ha-nova:write`

## Bootstrap (once per session)

Read and follow `../ha-nova/session-bootstrap.md`.
Verify relay CLI: `ha-nova relay health`
If this fails: `ha-nova setup`

## Relay Contract

Use file-based requests:
- `ha-nova relay ws --data-file <payload-file>`
- `ha-nova relay core --method <METHOD> --path <PATH> --body-file <payload-file>`
- `--out <result-file>` for large responses, `--jq-file <filter-file>` for filters

Relay-core response body: `.data.body` (`skills/ha-nova/relay-api.md` → Standard Envelope).

## Editability Guard (critical)

Only registry `platform: "homeassistant"` scenes are editable through the scene config API. Integration-owned scenes (for example Hue) have no HA-side config — reads return 404 and writes must never be attempted. Resolve the platform BEFORE any config operation:

Create `<payload-file>` with `{"type":"config/entity_registry/get","entity_id":"scene.<slug>"}`, then:
```text
ha-nova relay ws --data-file <payload-file> --out <registry-file>
```
- `platform` must be `homeassistant`; otherwise explain that this scene belongs to an integration and is managed in that integration's own app, then stop.
- `unique_id` is the scene config id for `/api/config/scene/config/<id>` — never use the entity_id slug as the config id.

## Flow

Drafts follow `skills/ha-nova/smallest-solution.md`: the complete requested outcome in the simplest safe design, nothing for hypothetical future needs.


### List
1. Registry: create `<payload-file>` with `{"type":"config/entity_registry/list"}`, then:
```text
ha-nova relay ws --data-file <payload-file> --jq-file <filter-file> --out <result-file>
```
Write `<filter-file>` with:
```jq
[.data[] | select(.entity_id | startswith("scene.")) | {entity_id, name: (.name // .original_name), platform, editable: (.platform == "homeassistant")}]
```
2. Read `/api/states` and append `scene.*` entities missing from the registry as `editable: false` — YAML scenes without an `id:` have no registry entry and are otherwise invisible to list, search, and the duplicate-name check.

### Read
1. Resolve `unique_id` + platform (Editability Guard).
2. `ha-nova relay core --method GET --path /api/config/scene/config/<unique_id> --out <result-file>`
3. Present name, entities, and captured target states. Flag captured entity_ids missing from the registry (renamed or deleted since capture — the scene then applies partially, silently); offer removal, never preserve or drop silently.

### Create
1. Resolve every entity the scene should capture (exact `entity_id`; on ambiguity ask one blocking question). Scenes take actionable domains only (light, switch, cover, climate, fan, media_player, lock, humidifier, stateful `input_*` — never stateless `input_button`, ...); refuse read-only domains (sensor, binary_sensor, ...). If the scene list (List flow, both sources) already has this name, ask before creating a duplicate. Read each entity's state; warn on `unknown`/`unavailable` and omit it unless the user insists.
2. Build the config body — `id` in the body MUST equal the id in the path; use the current epoch-milliseconds string as the new id (HA editor convention; POSIX example `date +%s000`). The POST is an upsert: before creating, GET the id and require a 404 so an existing scene is never silently overwritten.
   ```json
   {"id":"<epoch-ms>","name":"<name>","icon":"mdi:sofa","entities":{"<entity_id>":{"state":"on"}}}
   ```
   `icon` is optional. Entity values are the target states (plus attributes) applied on activation.
3. **Capture attributes deliberately** (the HA editor grabs only state + brightness for lights):
   - light that is on: `state`, `brightness`, plus exactly ONE color attribute matching its `color_mode` (`color_temp_kelvin`, `hs_color`, `rgb_color`, `xy_color`, `rgbw_color`, or `rgbww_color`) — never both, mixed color attributes reproduce wrong; an off light exposes no color attributes, capture `state: "off"` only
   - prefer individual lights over light groups — group snapshots are a known HA reproduce-state trouble spot
   - switch/lock/input_boolean: `state` only
   - other domains: `state` plus the attributes scene reproduction actually reads. A scene stores STATE attributes, not service parameters, and the two differ per domain: a cover stores `current_position` / `current_tilt_position` (storing `position` loses a partial target — the cover then just opens fully), while a setpoint domain stores the setpoint itself — climate `hvac_mode` plus whichever setpoint the state actually carries — `temperature` on a single-setpoint thermostat, `target_temp_low` AND `target_temp_high` on one in a range mode; capture both when both are present, or activating the scene restores the mode without either boundary. Climate reproduction also restores `preset_mode`, `fan_mode`, `swing_mode`, `swing_horizontal_mode` and `humidity`, each through its own service — capture every one the state actually carries, or the scene silently leaves the AC on yesterday's Boost preset while the temperature looks right. Humidifier `humidity`/`mode`, fan `percentage`/`preset_mode` plus `oscillating` and `direction` when present — and never its `current_*` sensor twin (`current_temperature`, `current_humidity`); never copy measurement or diagnostic attributes
4. Preview name + full entities map; natural confirmation bound to this exact preview (see context skill → Active Preview Confirmation). Creates may join a grouped change set (max 10) per `skills/ha-nova/grouped-change-set.md` — previews stay, one final confirmation.
5. `ha-nova relay core --method POST --path /api/config/scene/config/<id> --body-file <payload-file>`
6. Read back via GET and verify the fields; the config API reloads scenes automatically. Resolve the new entity_id from the registry by matching `unique_id` to the config id (the entity_id derives from `name`, not the id; never guess the slug — the registry can lag the write by a moment, retry once), then confirm it via `/api/states/<entity_id>`.

### Create from current state ("save this room as a scene")
Same as Create, but the entities map IS the live state: read each requested entity's state and copy it (attribute rules from Create step 3). Show captured entities and values before confirming.
Persistence routing per `skills/ha-nova/best-practices.md` → Persistence Model: a stored scene is a static capture that never updates itself; `scene.create` snapshots and automation-driven save → modify → restore cycles hand off to `ha-nova:write` (helpers, not scenes).

### Update
1. Read the current config (Read flow).
2. Merge the requested change in memory — the POST replaces the ENTIRE scene config; never send a partial body and never drop entities the user did not mention.
3. When the update adds or changes a member that assigns a threshold-backing `input_number` consumed by a physical-process `numeric_state`, run the calibration preflight per `skills/ha-nova/threshold-calibration.md` first. Preview a concise before/after excerpt plus a plain-language line on what changes behaviorally (write-safety → Behavior narrative) — never entity counts alone; natural confirmation bound to this exact preview. Non-destructive storage-scene worksets (max 10) may confirm as one grouped change set per `skills/ha-nova/grouped-change-set.md`.
4. If the conversation paused between read and confirmation, re-read and re-verify the merge basis before writing; if the live scene differs from the previewed basis, STOP — confirmation expired; show the updated merge and ask again (never silently overwrite an external edit). Apply the orphaned-member flag from Read step 3. When the confirmed update REMOVES scene members, capture the auto config snapshot first (`skills/ha-nova/config-snapshots.md`; on capture failure follow its capture-failure stop).
5. POST the full merged body, then read back and verify both the intended change and the survival of unrelated entities.

### Delete
1. Resolve id + platform (Editability Guard).
2. Consumer check: `{"type":"search/related","item_type":"entity","item_id":"scene.<slug>"}` — read through `skills/ha-nova/search-related-consumers.jq` (recreate per `skills/ha-nova/relay-api.md` → Parsing rule on flat-copy installs); show referencing automations/scripts, or an explicit no-consumer result (only a verified-shape empty `data` object means no consumers; a failed read is inconclusive, never a no-consumer claim).
3. Require exact confirmation code `confirm:<token>` — generate a short code, display it in the Options slot, and proceed only when the user types it back exactly. Deleting several storage scenes at once follows `skills/ha-nova/batch-safety.md` (Editability Guard per target).
4. Capture the auto config snapshot of the current config first (`skills/ha-nova/config-snapshots.md`; on capture failure follow its capture-failure stop).
5. `ha-nova relay core --method DELETE --path /api/config/scene/config/<id>`
6. Verify absence: config GET returns status 404 and the entity is gone. Mention the snapshot restore path in the result.

## Error Handling

- A scene entity's state is the timestamp of its last activation; `unknown` means "never activated" — not an error.
- Config GET 404 on a `homeassistant`-platform scene: the scene was deleted outside this session — re-list instead of retrying.
- Registry get miss on a live scene entity: a YAML scene without an `id:` — not API-editable; point to `scenes.yaml`.
- POST/DELETE failures: show HA's error, stop; do not retry blind. If every scene config call fails, `scenes.yaml` may be missing from the config includes — point to HA docs.
- Full relay error taxonomy: `skills/ha-nova/relay-api.md` → Error Handling.

## Output Format

Apply `skills/ha-nova/output-rules.md` to all user-facing output. Write previews, delete confirmations, and results render as the Cards defined there.

- `Scene`
- `Mode`
- `Planned change`
- `Save status` / `Delete status` before confirmation
- `Options` / confirmation-code prompt
- `Verification`
- `Next step`

Use stable localized slot labels in this order; omit empty slots. Reads render the Report shape; scene lists render the List Frame (output-rules.md).

## Safety

- Preview before write: nothing is saved until the user confirms the shown preview.
- Confirmation binds to the displayed preview and expires on any change to target, payload, endpoint, or scope (context skill → Active Preview Confirmation).
- Pre-preview phrases ("do it", "go ahead", "implement the plan") authorize drafting and preview only — never the write itself.
- Delete and destructive operations require the typed confirmation code `confirm:<token>` verbatim; "yes" or any natural-language reply is invalid.
- Never guess entity, service, or config IDs — resolve them or ask.
- Home Assistant is reached exclusively through `ha-nova relay`.
- For any HA write this skill does not cover, STOP and invoke `ha-nova:fallback` first — never probe unfamiliar write endpoints.

- Create/update use natural confirmation after preview; delete uses exact confirmation code only, even for scenes created earlier in the same session.
- Scene writes have no `revert`; recovery is the auto config snapshot (deletes and member-removing updates capture one). Offer a safety backup via `ha-nova:backup` before a delete only when the snapshot store is unavailable (never for routine edits).
- One scene per mutation; verify read-back, not just the save response.
- Activation hands off to `ha-nova:service-call` — `scene.turn_on` supports `transition` (lights only); `scene.apply` applies a one-off state set without storing a scene.
- After a verified create/update, OFFER an apply-test: one Test-Plan-style card (mechanics: `skills/ha-nova/test-run.md` — name every member device and its target state, single bound confirmation, run via `scene.turn_on`, verify the timestamp advanced plus member states). Say honestly that activation changes real devices and prior states are not restored. members are classified by `skills/ha-nova/indirect-actuation.md`, not by a list kept here — that gate also covers nested script and scene runs, `template`-platform members, physically irreversible actions, and members whose owning skill already demands the typed tier. Anything it puts on the typed tier keeps the typed confirmation code from the context skill's high-consequence tier — the single card confirmation never replaces it.
