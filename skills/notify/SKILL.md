description: Use when sending a Home Assistant notification NOW — discovering notify targets, sending a message to a phone or speaker, building mobile-app notifications, and managing persistent notifications — through HA NOVA Relay. For "notify me WHEN something happens" use ha-nova:write, which builds the automation.

# HA NOVA Notify

## Scope

Notification delivery and management:
- discover available notify targets (entities and legacy services)
- send a notification to a phone, a notify group, or another target
- mobile-app extras: tag/replace, actionable buttons, priority/channel, click URL, images
- persistent notifications inside the Home Assistant UI (list, create, dismiss)

Not in scope: notifications INSIDE an automation or script (that is the automation's action — `ha-nova:write`), TTS announcements to speakers (`ha-nova:media`).

## Bootstrap (once per session)

Read and follow `../ha-nova/session-bootstrap.md`.
Verify relay CLI: `ha-nova relay health`
If this fails: `ha-nova setup`

## Relay Contract

- `ha-nova relay core --method GET --path /api/services --out <result-file>` to discover notify services
- `ha-nova relay ws --data-file <payload-file>` for WS commands (entity registry, persistent notifications)
- `ha-nova relay core --method GET --path /api/states --out <result-file>` — the household-routing read: `person.*` states before the preview and again before sending
- `ha-nova relay core --method POST --path /api/services/<domain>/<service> --body-file <payload-file>` to send
- `--jq-file <filter-file>` for non-trivial filters

## Target Discovery (do this first)

Home Assistant has TWO notification surfaces, and picking the wrong one silently drops features:

| Surface | How to call | Use it for |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Notify ENTITIES (`notify.*` entities, modern) | `notify.send_message` with `entity_id` + `message` (+ `title`) | Plain messages, and notify groups built in the UI |
| Notify SERVICES (`notify.mobile_app_<device>`, legacy platform) | `notify.mobile_app_<device>` with `message`, `title`, `data: {...}` | Everything the entity platform cannot do: actionable buttons, `tag` replace/clear, sticky/persistent alerts, Android channel/importance, notification icon, click URL, attachments |

Discovery:
1. Services: `GET /api/services`, filter the `notify` domain — the `mobile_app_*` entries are the per-device legacy targets.
2. Entities: WS `{"type":"config/entity_registry/list_for_display"}`, filter `ei` starting with `notify.`.
3. Report the real, resolved targets — never guess a device name.

**Decision rule:** plain message to a known target → notify entity (`notify.send_message`). Any mobile-app extra (buttons, tag, sticky, channel, url, image) → the legacy `notify.mobile_app_<device>` service, because the entity platform does not carry the `data` payload for those. This rule instantiates the canonical contract's capability discovery for today's platform reality — the discovery rule wins if the platforms diverge.

Canonical contract: `../ha-nova/mobile-notification-composition.md` — read it before building any mobile-app payload; it owns composition precedence, surface selection, optional-field intent rules, actionable safeguards, notification commands, privacy, delivery honesty, and observed local conventions.

## Flow

1. Resolve the target with Target Discovery. If several devices match, present the candidates and ask once.
2. Before building an actionable payload, require an existing, verified
   `mobile_app_notification_action` automation filtered to the exact
   `event_data.action` ID. If absent, stop and hand off to `ha-nova:write`;
   this skill does not create a send-specific listener.
3. Build the payload:
   - entity: `{"entity_id":"notify.<target>","message":"...","title":"..."}` for `notify.send_message`
   - mobile app: `{"message":"...","title":"...","data":{...}}` for `notify.mobile_app_<device>`. Common `data` keys, and the platform split that silently drops fields when confused:
     - both platforms: `tag` (replace/clear an earlier notification), `actions` (actionable buttons), `image`/`video`/`audio`, `url` (iOS) / `clickAction` (Android).
     - **Android — direct keys inside `data`**: `channel`, `importance`, `ttl`, `priority`, `sticky`, `persistent`, `notification_icon`, `color`. Nesting these under `push` does nothing on Android.
     - **iOS — under `data.push`**: `interruption-level`, `sound`, `badge`. `push` is the iOS-only container; do not put Android channel/importance there.
     Read the target's platform from the device name or ask, and place the keys accordingly.
   - A `message: "clear_notification"` with a matching `tag` removes a previously sent notification instead of sending a new one.
4. Preview the exact payload (target + title + message + any `data`) and get confirmation — a notification is an irreversible, user-visible side effect.
5. Send, then report what was sent where: a successful service call means Home Assistant accepted it, not that the phone displayed it — say so honestly. There is no delivery receipt by default — one exists only through a pre-existing, verified received-event automation (canonical contract → Delivery honesty; never built ad hoc for a send); receipt never proves reading.

## Persistent Notifications (Home Assistant UI)

- list: WS `{"type":"persistent_notification/get"}`
- create: service `persistent_notification.create` with `message`, `title`, `notification_id`
- dismiss: service `persistent_notification.dismiss` with `notification_id`

These live only in the HA UI; they never reach a phone.

When composing a COMPLEX mobile-app payload (actionable buttons, images, critical alerts), offer a single test send to the chosen target first — the preview is the plan, the test proves rendering; acceptance-honesty applies (accepted, not delivered), and the real send follows only after the user judges the test.

### Household routing ("tell whoever is home")

Recipient-group and household resolution follow the shared contract `skills/ha-nova/membership-resolution.md`; the unreadable-presence handling below stays authoritative.

Presence-conditional sends resolve recipients before the preview AND again
immediately before sending: presence is the one input that changes on its own
while a confirmation waits, so the previewed list can be wrong by the time it
is approved. A changed list means a changed scope — re-preview rather than
send to the stale one. Read `person.*` states and sort them into three buckets, not two: `home`,
away (anything else, including a named zone like `work`), and UNREADABLE
(`unknown`/`unavailable` — no tracker had usable data). Never fold the third
into away: that turns a dropped phone into a silent omission from the send.
Name unreadable people in the preview and ask whether to include them; with
nobody readable, say so instead of reporting an empty household. Map each
recipient to their
REAL notify target from the `/api/services` discovery this skill
already requires. Never derive a service name from `person.device_trackers`:
those are tracker entity ids (router, GPS, a Companion App entity named
differently) and prove no association to a `notify.mobile_app_*` service. When
the mapping is not provable, ask once which target belongs to that person and
reuse the answer for the session. Preview the
resolved recipient list, not the rule — "Anna and Ben are home" is what the
user confirms. Nobody home is a real answer: say so and offer the persistent
notification instead of silently sending to everyone.

Inside an automation this is a `choose` per person (`ha-nova:write`), not this
flow.

## Error Handling

Full relay/upstream error taxonomy: `skills/ha-nova/relay-api.md` -> Error Handling. Notify specifics:
- `404/NOT_FOUND` on `notify.mobile_app_<device>`: the device name is wrong or the companion app is not registered — re-discover, never guess.
- A service call returning 200 says nothing about delivery: the phone may be offline, or Android may hold the message while dozing (`priority: high` in `data` affects that).
- `notify.send_message` rejects mobile-app `data` extras — that is the entity-platform limit, not a payload bug: switch to the legacy service.
- An accepted send with silently ignored extras usually means the keys sat in the wrong place (Android keys under `push`, or iOS keys at top level) — re-check the platform split before blaming the device.

## Output Format

Apply `skills/ha-nova/output-rules.md` to all user-facing output. Write previews, delete confirmations, and results render as the Cards defined there.

Render the Report shape (output-rules.md): the resolved target, the sent title/message, and any extras used. Report acceptance honestly (accepted by Home Assistant, not confirmed on the device). Discovery renders the List Frame, grouped by surface (entities vs mobile-app services).

## Safety

- Preview before write: nothing is saved until the user confirms the shown preview.
- Confirmation binds to the displayed preview and expires on any change to target, payload, endpoint, or scope (context skill → Active Preview Confirmation).
- Pre-preview phrases ("do it", "go ahead", "implement the plan") authorize drafting and preview only — never the write itself.
- Delete and destructive operations require the typed confirmation code `confirm:<token>` verbatim; "yes" or any natural-language reply is invalid.
- Never guess entity, service, or config IDs — resolve them or ask.
- Home Assistant is reached exclusively through `ha-nova relay`.
- For any HA write this skill does not cover, STOP and invoke `ha-nova:fallback` first — never probe unfamiliar write endpoints.

- Drafts follow `skills/ha-nova/smallest-solution.md`: the complete requested outcome in the simplest safe design, nothing for hypothetical future needs.

- A notification is irreversible and user-visible: always preview the exact payload and confirm before sending, even for a single short message.
- Never send test notifications unprompted, and never send to every discovered target at once.
- Repeated/looping sends are not supported here; if the user wants recurring notifications, that is an automation — hand off to `ha-nova:write`.

## Guardrails

- One target per send unless the user explicitly asks for a group, or the recipients come from presence routing ("tell whoever is home") — in both cases show the full resolved member list in the preview.
- Never invent device names, `tag` values, or action IDs.
- Do not claim delivery — only acceptance (a supported receipt confirmation may prove device receipt, never reading).
