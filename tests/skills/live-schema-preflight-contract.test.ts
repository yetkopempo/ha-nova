// flows. Previews must come from the LIVE form, nothing terminal is submitted
// before the bound confirmation, drift and validation errors are explicit
// stops, and terminal `create_entry` identity extraction knows the nested
// `result.entry_id` shape (the observed miss: `.data.body.entry_id` read null
// while the entry existed).

// Pins are whitespace-normalized so a reflow of the Markdown never breaks them.
