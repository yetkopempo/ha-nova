  One-time privacy choice

  May this HA NOVA installation contribute to the maintainer's private
  installation and version statistics?
  HA NOVA sends no behavioral or feature-use analytics.
  Why this helps: by contributing, you give the maintainer a rough picture of
  how many installations participate, which HA NOVA and Relay versions they use,
  and how operating systems are distributed. This helps prioritize compatibility
  work, tests, bug fixes, and new features where they are likely to help most.
  If you agree, HA NOVA sends the first report now. Further reports are sent
  no sooner than seven days later.
  The message content (JSON) contains only:
      payload schema  ·  random Census installation ID
      HA NOVA version  ·  operating system
      recently observed relay version (when available)
  The random ID only lets the same participating installation count once. It
  is not derived from or reused from a hardware or device identifier, pairing,
  a user, a Relay, or Home Assistant. HA NOVA attaches no device data.
  No usage or Home Assistant data is sent.
  Cloudflare is the hosting provider for the census endpoint. It processes the
  source IP and connection metadata for HTTPS under its privacy policy.
  HA NOVA ingest code does not read or store the source IP.
  Counts are voluntary and self-reported, not verified people or the complete
  installed base.

const censusSkillNoticeBlock = `CENSUS ASK PENDING: Present one standalone localized privacy choice after the requested task, but defer it while any other choice or confirmation is active. A deferred notice remains pending. Immediately before a conflict-free presentation, run ha-nova census notice-presented. Render the choice only if its output is CENSUS NOTICE PRESENT followed by a cns-choice ID; if it says CENSUS NOTICE SKIP or the command fails, render nothing. Keep that exact choice ID bound to all three actions in this interaction. Make the census choice the response's only active choice and end the response after its options. Use a native selectable menu when available and the identical numbered fallback otherwise; if the UI requires a default, use No. Ask whether this HA NOVA installation may contribute to the maintainer's private installation and version statistics. Before asking, explain in friendly, non-pressuring language that by contributing, the user helps the maintainer get a rough picture of how many installations participate, which HA NOVA and Relay versions they use, and how operating systems are distributed. This helps prioritize compatibility work, tests, bug fixes, and new features where they are likely to help most. Present this as a directional planning input, not a roadmap vote or feature promise; participation remains optional, and the explanation must not use guilt, pressure, or recommend opt-in. If the user agrees, HA NOVA sends the first report now; further reports are sent no sooner than seven days later. The fixed JSON body contains only the payload schema, a dedicated random Census installation ID, HA NOVA version, operating system, and a recently observed Relay version when available. The ID only lets the same participating installation count once. It is not derived from or reused from a hardware or device identifier, pairing, a user, a Relay, or Home Assistant; HA NOVA attaches no device data. No usage or Home Assistant data is sent. Cloudflare is the hosting provider and processes the JSON and source IP/connection metadata of the same HTTPS request under its privacy policy. HA NOVA ingest code does not read or store the source IP. Counts are voluntary, self-reported participating installations, not verified people or the complete installed base. Use at most five short visible lines in this order: purpose/planning value; cadence; exact JSON field categories plus no usage/Home Assistant data; random-ID counting and origin; Cloudflare processing, HA NOVA source-IP non-reading/non-storage, and the voluntary-count limitation. Offer exactly these effects: Yes/contribute -> run ha-nova census choose <choice-id> yes; No/do not contribute -> run ha-nova census choose <choice-id> no; Show exact data -> run ha-nova census status without changing consent, display the literal JSON object verbatim plus the Cloudflare transport disclosure without omitting or renaming fields, then immediately show the same choice again with the same choice ID. Only a selection of the displayed Yes or No effect, including its numbered fallback, changes consent. Missing, dismissed, free-form, or ambiguous input runs nothing. If census status fails, name the error, state that consent is unchanged, and immediately show the same choice again with the same choice ID. If a choose command fails, report that the stale choice was not saved and inspect current status; never fall back to unbound census on/off. Details: docs/reference/census.md.`
