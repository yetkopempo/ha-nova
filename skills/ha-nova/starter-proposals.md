# Starter Proposals — "Analyze my home and suggest automations"

Owned by the context skill. Evidence-gated: every proposal names the concrete
entities that justify it; a pattern with no matching hardware is never
proposed. Read-only until the user accepts an item.

## Inventory (bounded, read-only)

1. One `/api/states` pull with `--out <result-file>`; extract per-domain
   entity lists via `relay jq` (never print the dump).
2. One automation inventory: the `automation.*` rows from the same pull PLUS
   registry-disabled automations via a FULL entity-registry read
   (`config/entity_registry/list` — the compact list carries no `unique_id`,
   which IS the disabled rows' config key) — disabled automations have no
   states row, and a states row proves nothing about WHAT an automation
   does. A YAML automation or scene without an explicit `id` has no readable
   config: count it and report the duplicate scan as PARTIAL, never as
   complete. Scene candidates use the `scene.*` rows from the same pull for the id
   list only — members come from config reads (rule 2b).
2b. Duplicate gate, config-evidence only: before a candidate enters the
   Suggestion Block, read the existing automations' configs — the config key
   is each automation's `id` ATTRIBUTE from its states row (registry
   `unique_id` for disabled rows), never the entity id. Bound the pass: cap
   the config reads (default 50) and report anything
   beyond the cap as PARTIAL — the cap line names how many configs went
   unread. Scan each read WHOLE config document: triggers, conditions,
   actions, selector targets, and `use_blueprint.input` all carry entity ids
   literally; a blueprint config has no expanded sections — it drops
   the candidate only when its input NAMES identify the roles (e.g. a
   motion-entity input holding the sensor and a light-target input holding
   the lamp); bare co-occurrence in uninterpretable inputs falls into the
   closed PARTIAL rule, never a drop; match the
   candidate's role entities AND every selector value that resolves to them
   — `device_id`, `area_id`, `label_id`, `floor_id`, from the candidates'
   own EFFECTIVE registry memberships: a device-inherited area — plus that
   area's floor — and device- or area-level labels count (a
   selector-targeted automation never names the entity). A selector hit counts only in the role's FUNCTION: a device_id
   match on the source side needs that sensor's own trigger type, and an
   area/label-targeted action needs the action role's domain service —
   otherwise it is no pairing evidence. A candidate drops only when ONE config references its COMPLETE
   role pairing ON ONE EXECUTABLE PATH: each SOURCE role in triggers — or in
   conditions when EITHER that branch's trigger is time-driven
   (time/time_pattern/sun, the watchdog shape) OR another role of the SAME
   candidate supplies that branch's trigger (the away-alert shape: door
   trigger + presence condition); a sensor merely gating an unrelated
   trigger is no source role
   plus the ACTION role in the actions that branch actually runs — in
   configs with trigger-id/choose branches, cross-branch co-occurrence does
   not drop the candidate (name it in the evidence line instead) — and role
   co-occurrence in any executable shape this rule does not recognize
   (`wait_for_trigger`, wait templates, nested branches) never lets the
   pass claim "not automated yet" silently: name the co-occurrence in the
   evidence line the same way. The pairing must also match the candidate's behavior
   DIRECTION: a no-motion→off automation is the complement of motion→on,
   not its duplicate — complements are named in the evidence line, never a
   drop. A pairing found only in an automation that cannot fire is never a
   silent drop and never a duplicate drop: the candidate keeps its menu
   slot reframed as the enable offer ("already built but disabled — enable
   it instead?"); accepting hands a registry-disabled row to
   `ha-nova:organize`'s enable flow and a state-off row to the
   service-call path (`automation.turn_on`).
   A single shared entity in an unrelated automation is no duplicate. An
   aggregate role (battery levels, the room's lights) drops the candidate
   only when the config covers the role's FUNCTION aggregate-wide (a
   template, group, or label over the whole role); coverage of single
   entities is named in the evidence line ('2 of 12 batteries already
   alerted') and those covered members are excluded from the accepted
   item's target set, never a drop. Service-shaped roles (a `notify.*` target) match by
   SERVICE NAME in the config's actions, not by entity id — and a modern
   notify ENTITY also matches as the `target`/`entity_id` of a
   `notify.send_message` call. Two more equivalence expansions: a group target
   matches when its membership PROVABLY contains the candidate — the
   `entity_id` states attribute where present; membership the pass cannot
   prove falls into the closed PARTIAL rule; a presence source role matches zone-count
   guards (`zone.home` state) and direct `person.*`/`device_tracker.*`
   conditions alike — but only with the POLARITY the candidate needs: an
   at-home guard (zone count > 0, or state `home`) never evidences an away
   alert. CLOSED RULE
   for everything else: any config whose references the pass cannot FULLY
   resolve — dynamic Jinja-computed targets, unexpanded groups, delegation
   through items whose configs this pass did not read and resolve — makes
   the duplicate scan PARTIAL, and a
   PARTIAL scan downgrades every affected evidence line from "not automated
   yet" to "no duplicate found (scan partial)". Never enumerate past this
   rule: unresolvable evidence fails closed into honesty, not into a claim. When the pass is capped, say the
   duplicate gate was partial — never claim "not automated yet" from states
   rows or aliases. Disabled storage scenes join the scene inventory via the
   same registry-disabled read as automations. Scene MEMBER checks — enabled
   and disabled alike — read the scene's CONFIG by id; neither the registry
   row nor a states attribute is member evidence.
2c. Area pairing resolves area-first per the architecture reference:
   `search/related` on the area — this covers entities that inherit their
   area from their device; the compact registry's `ai` field alone misses
   inherited membership. `config/area_registry/list` supplies the names.
3. Optional, only when a candidate needs it: one bounded history window (via
   `ha-nova:history`'s bounded read) for ONE entity to check real usage
   (e.g. does the motion sensor actually fire?). Never a per-entity history
   sweep.

## Evidence-gated pattern table

| Propose | Only when the inventory shows | Hands to |
|---|---|---|
| Motion-activated light | motion/occupancy sensor AND light in the same area, no automation pairing them | `ha-nova:write` |
| Door-open-while-away alert | door/window sensor AND a person/device_tracker, no such alert yet | `ha-nova:write` |
| Low-battery notification | battery-level entities AND a notify target — notify ENTITIES or the notify domain's services from `/api/services` (mobile-app targets live only there) | `ha-nova:write` |
| Movie scene | media_player AND lights in the same area, and no existing `scene.*` already grouping them (member check via scene CONFIG reads, rule 2b) | `ha-nova:scene` |
| Presence-simulation while away | lights AND a person/device_tracker (pattern per `automation-patterns.md`) | `ha-nova:write` |
| Stale-sensor watchdog | a sensor whose updates matter (per the user's stated interest) | `ha-nova:write` |

The table is the catalog ceiling: never invent a proposal outside it from a
cold start. Area pairing comes from the entity/area registries, not from
name-string guessing.

## Output

- At most 4 items (the Interactive Choices menu cap), rendered as ONE
  Suggestion Block (💡, numbered); each item: short title + the evidence
  line ("motion sensor + lamp in the living room, not paired yet") + what
  it would do.
- Fewer real candidates than 4 → show fewer; zero → say so honestly and name
  what hardware would unlock which pattern. MORE than 4 → apply Progressive
  Detail (output-rules.md): name how many were omitted and the exact
  follow-up that shows the rest.
- Each accepted number REVALIDATES its evidence first — a fresh duplicate
  check for that candidate (the menu may be stale; an earlier accepted item
  may have created exactly this pairing); gone-stale offers say so instead
  of previewing. Then it hands to the owning skill INDIVIDUALLY — one normal
  preview/confirm flow per item, never a batch write. Skip/decline is always
  valid; nothing runs from the menu itself.
