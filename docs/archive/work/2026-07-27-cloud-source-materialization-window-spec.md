# Cloud Source Materialization Window Follow-up

Status: merged — single-shot post-fix canary passed on 2026-07-28

## Problem

Canary PR #457 reproduced the GitHub materialization race after PR #456. The
completed broker started from trusted `main`, but GitHub did not expose the
current pull request's merge commit and merge ref before the 60-second window
expired. Both appeared immediately after the broker emitted its fail-closed
rejection. The provisional App check was terminally rejected and no pending
check remained.

After the 90-second fix reached `main`, canary PR #460 showed a narrower API
race: GitHub exposed the exact pull-request merge ref and its commit while the
full pull-request response still returned a null `merge_commit_sha` throughout
the bounded window.

## Required behavior

- Keep one bounded retry loop inside the existing completed broker run.
- Use one 90-second acceptance deadline for current pull-request association,
  the full pull-request merge commit, and the exact
  `refs/pull/<number>/merge` ref.
- When the full pull-request response still omits `merge_commit_sha`, accept
  the exact merge ref only after its commit proves the expected parent order:
  current base SHA followed by current head SHA.
- Keep the strict API/ref equality check whenever `merge_commit_sha` is
  available. Never use the parent proof while an API/ref mismatch for the
  current PR, base, and head remains unresolved.
- Retry a temporarily absent merge-commit object inside the same window.
  Authentication, server, timeout, and malformed-response failures remain
  fail-loud.
- Keep the three-second retry cadence and derive the attempt cap from the
  window so both bounds cannot drift.
- Measure the acceptance deadline with a monotonic clock.
- Revalidate the CI attempt after materialization and immediately before
  every terminal result. An older attempt only cleans up its own pending
  checks, including when cleanup or policy execution fails.
- Revalidate the merge ref both before and after the final pull-request and CI
  observations so a moving ref cannot escape the terminal source binding.
- Revalidate the CI attempt again after the final ref read and immediately
  before terminal success.
- Reconcile accepted check creation through a short bounded visibility window
  when the GitHub API response is lost; repeat cleanup across that window when
  creation remains ambiguous.
- Preserve the existing fail-closed rejection, terminal immutability,
  provisional cleanup, command/API deadlines, and ten-minute workflow cap.
- Never accept a source that becomes consistent after the acceptance deadline.
- Cover association, merge-commit, absent-ref, inconsistent-ref, deadline, and
  rerun races after the previous 60-second attempt cap.
- Do not rerun the remote canary from this change.
