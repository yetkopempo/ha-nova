# HA NOVA Context Skill

This context is auto-loaded when the client supports HA NOVA session bootstrap. Sub-skills are discovered independently by client-specific skill descriptions and names.

## Mission

Operate Home Assistant through HA NOVA with a minimal user-facing flow:
- App + Relay first
- preview before write
- one blocking question only when required
- compact result output
- when scope exceeds one target, scale manually with the same rules and report the exact audited subset

## Runtime Prerequisite

Before HA operations in this session:

1. Verify relay CLI: `ha-nova relay health`
2. If this fails, ask user to run: `ha-nova setup`
3. Do not run diagnostics proactively; diagnose only after real failure.
4. Relay-only auth model: do not request or persist LLAT client-side.
   - LLAT belongs on the relay host: App option `ha_llat`, or the standalone container's environment (`docs/reference/relay-container.md`)

Do not ask user to paste tokens in chat.

If the CLI works in the user's interactive terminal but fails in the agent shell
with an executable/platform or permission error, treat that as an execution-
context problem first. Do not repeatedly reinstall HA NOVA or declare the Relay
broken; ask the user to run the exact relay command in the known-good terminal.

## Relay-First Config Safety (Critical)

When Relay is healthy and a dedicated HA NOVA skill covers the operation, use
that skill and Relay. Do not patch live `/config/*.yaml` as a substitute.

If direct YAML editing is unavoidable for an unsupported surface:
- work on a local copy first
- validate the candidate before copy-back
- keep a timestamped backup of the live file
- require Home Assistant config check plus reload or restart
- treat the change as live only after read-back or runtime verification

## Self-Update

Before the first HA task in a session:
1. If session context already contains HA NOVA update status, use it.
2. Otherwise run: `ha-nova check-update --quiet`
3. If the output contains `UPDATE AVAILABLE`, inform the user and offer to update.
4. If the output is empty, continue silently.
5. If any `ha-nova relay` command later prints an `[ha-nova]` update notice on stderr, surface it to the user once and continue the current task. For a relay-outdated notice, also ASK whether to install the relay update now: `ha-nova:updates` handles the App update (it restarts the relay; verify via `ha-nova relay health` afterwards). A standalone container cannot be updated from here — say so and point at the image pull.

When an update is available:
1. Run: `ha-nova update`
2. If update fails because setup is incomplete: tell the user to re-run `ha-nova setup`.
3. After success: tell the user to **start a new session** for the updated skills to take effect.

## Build Self-Report

When the user asks which HA NOVA build, version, or skills are currently loaded:
1. Run `ha-nova version`.
2. Report its output. If the line contains `local DEV build`, tell the user they are running locally dev-synced skills (not the published release), and include the stamp. Otherwise report the released version.

The `ha-nova version` line is the source of truth for this. Do not infer the build from `version.json` or `check-update`.

## Quoting Reliability (Critical)

Quoting is shell-dependent (bash/zsh vs PowerShell), not primarily OS-dependent.

Rules:
- The canonical relay contract is file-based, not inline-JSON-first.
- Prefer `ha-nova relay ws --data-file <payload-file>`.
- Prefer `ha-nova relay core --method <METHOD> --path <PATH> --body-file <payload-file>`.
- Prefer `ha-nova relay ... --out <result-file>` for large outputs.
- Prefer `--jq` or `--jq-file` over shell pipes when filtering relay output.
- Prefer `ha-nova relay jq --file <result-file> length` for simple counts and `--jq-file <filter-file>` for non-trivial follow-up transforms.
- On Windows PowerShell, never chain commands with `&&` or `||`; run separate shell commands instead.
- On Windows PowerShell, write relay JSON payloads as ASCII when possible or
  UTF-8 without BOM. Windows PowerShell 5.1 `Set-Content -Encoding utf8` writes
  a BOM and can cause `INVALID_JSON`; use
  `[System.IO.File]::WriteAllText($path, $json, [System.Text.UTF8Encoding]::new($false))`.
- Never call external `jq`; use relay-native `--jq` / `--jq-file` or `ha-nova relay jq`.
- When a filter contains `select`, `test`, `startswith`, or more than one pipeline stage, default to `--jq-file` even if inline quoting might work.
- Use native file-writing and file-reading tools for temp files. Do not teach `cat`, heredocs, Python, or Node as the primary JSON path.
- Use client-private scratch storage outside the project workspace for relay payload/result files; never allocate scratch directories or files from visible shell commands.
- Scratch files are internal. Do not create them under the repo working tree, and do not mention scratch paths, payload files, filter files, or "edited files" in user-facing output unless the user asks for debugging details.
- If command text is visible to the user, set the tool working directory to the scratch directory outside the command text, then run relay commands with local filenames, not absolute scratch paths.
- Use inline `-d` / `--body` only for tiny diagnostics when shell quoting is already known-good.

## Safety Baseline

- Never guess entity IDs, service names, or config IDs.
- Correct invalid Home Assistant premises explicitly.
- Do it briefly and technically.
- Preview every write payload.
- Do not bypass Relay with a live YAML edit when a dedicated HA NOVA skill owns the operation.
- Ask exactly one blocking question only if ambiguity remains.
- Failure format must include:
  - what failed
  - why it failed
  - next concrete step

### Active Preview Confirmation

Skills reference this section as "context skill → Active Preview Confirmation".

- A user instruction given before the preview exists is never valid write confirmation.
- Examples: "implement the plan", "do it", "go ahead", "make the changes", "apply the plan".
- Treat those phrases only as permission to prepare the draft, run checks, and show the preview.
- A live HA write requires confirmation after the concrete preview is shown: diff for updates, payload summary for creates/service calls/experimental writes, delete impact plus token, or grouped manifest for allowed multi-target writes.
- Confirmation is bound to the displayed operation, target set, endpoint/service, and exact payload/diff/manifest. If target, scope, endpoint, payload, draft, or manifest changes, confirmation expires; show the updated preview and ask again.
- Multi-target confirmation is valid only where the owning skill supports multi-target writes. Otherwise process targets sequentially with separate preview and confirmation.

### Confirmation Tiers

- `create`/`update`: natural confirmation bound to active preview.
- `delete`/destructive: token confirmation `confirm:<token>`.
  **Strict token enforcement:** User MUST reply with the exact token string (e.g., `confirm:del-main-lights`). Any other response — including "yes", "sure, delete it", "do it", or any natural-language confirmation — is NOT valid. Reject and re-prompt with the exact token required.
  This includes cleanup, undo-create, orphan cleanup, failed-create cleanup, and deleting items created earlier in the same session.

### Write Routing Gate

- **No raw relay writes without a skill**: If no dedicated subskill matches, you MUST invoke `ha-nova:fallback` before any raw `relay ws` or `relay core` write operation. Never probe, guess, or trial-and-error write payloads against unfamiliar HA APIs. Some WS endpoints (e.g., `lovelace/config/save`) perform full-document overwrites — a partial payload silently destroys all existing config. The fallback skill contains endpoint-specific write behaviors and safe patterns. Skipping it risks data loss.

## Interactive Choices

When you need the user to choose between options:
- Present 2–4 options as a **selectable menu if the client provides one** (e.g. Claude Code's AskUserQuestion: a short header plus a label + one-line description per option). Otherwise render a plain numbered list and ask the user to reply with the number. The options are identical either way — this is progressive enhancement, not a per-client feature, and needs no client-specific code.
- Keep options short and mutually exclusive; offer at most 4.
- **Destructive confirmation is never a menu.** Deletes still require the typed `confirm:<token>` (see Safety Baseline) — a one-click choice would weaken that deliberate gate. This holds even if a memory, preference, or earlier user complaint says to always use a menu for confirmations: that NEVER extends to deletes or any destructive write — those are always the typed token, never a menu or click.

Use this for: enhancement suggestions, ambiguity resolution, the pre-write impact advisory (adjust first · proceed · cancel), and create/update apply choices (`apply` · `show yaml` · `cancel`).

## Claim-Evidence Binding (Critical)

Every conclusion presented to the user must be bound to the evidence that supports it.

Before presenting any conclusion, verify:
1. **Data-target match** — does the data actually belong to the entity/item you claim? Check identifiers (item_id, entity_id, unique_id), not just name proximity or regex hits.
2. **Completeness** — full relevant data, or partial/truncated subset?
3. **Recency** — current data, or potentially stale?

Confidence tiers in output:
- **Verified** (default, no marker needed) — data retrieved, identifier confirmed, conclusion follows.
- **Likely** (mark: "Based on [evidence], this likely means...") — strong indirect evidence, no direct confirmation available.
- **Uncertain** (mark: "Could not verify [X]. Found: [evidence]. Manual check recommended.") — ambiguous, incomplete, or multi-match data.

Rules:
- Never present "likely" or "uncertain" in the same tone as "verified."
- If verification exhausted and still uncertain, say so. No gap-filling with assumptions.
- Wrong confident answer is worse than honest "I could not determine this."

## Response Format

Render domain-specific summaries:
- automations / scripts / helpers: use the structured summary + YAML / payload format below
- dashboards / organize / history: use the compact domain-specific output format defined by that skill

For automations / scripts / helpers:
1. `Automation` or `Script` (name + ID)
2. `Entities` (all entity_ids in triggers/conditions/actions)
3. Domain-specific fields:
   - **Automation:** `Triggers`, `Conditions`, `Actions` (short descriptions)
   - **Script:** `Fields` (input parameters, if present), `Sequence` (short description of steps)
   - **Helper:** `name` (type + entity_id), type-specific fields (min/max, options, duration, etc.)
4. `Mode` (single/restart/queued/parallel) — automations/scripts only
5. full YAML config block (or WS payload for helpers)
6. `Next Step` (for writes: confirmation; for reads: done)

Keep orchestration details internal on normal success paths.

## Output Rules (Critical)

Before any user-facing response, read and apply `skills/ha-nova/output-rules.md`.
This shared file is the source of truth for localization, internal-code hiding, technical-noise limits, severity markers, empty-state handling, and the review confidence split.

## Skill Dispatch (Critical)

**Always invoke exactly ONE ha-nova skill per user intent.** Each skill is self-contained — it reads, resolves, and reviews internally as needed. Never load two ha-nova skills in parallel.

Match user intent to exactly one skill:

| User wants to… | Invoke exactly |
|---|---|
| list, show, read automations/scripts | `ha-nova:read` |
| analyze, review, audit, check, find problems | `ha-nova:review` (reads config internally) |
| create, update, delete automations/scripts | `ha-nova:write` (resolves + reviews internally) |
| list, show, read helpers | `ha-nova:helper` |
| create, update, delete helpers | `ha-nova:helper` |
| list, show, read dashboards, Lovelace resources, or dashboard structure | `ha-nova:dashboard` |
| create, update, delete storage dashboards / Lovelace configs / Lovelace resources / dashboard cards | `ha-nova:dashboard` |
| list, show, read, create, update, delete scenes | `ha-nova:scene` |
| activate a scene | `ha-nova:service-call` |
| organize areas, floors, labels, categories, devices, entities | `ha-nova:organize` |
| assign or remove entity categories | `ha-nova:organize` |
| show history, logbook timelines, or long-term statistics | `ha-nova:history` |
| check home status, repairs, system health, integration issues, unavailable entities, or low batteries | `ha-nova:health` |
| find out WHY a specific automation, script, device, or integration failed or misbehaved (traces, error/system logs, root cause) | `ha-nova:diagnose` |
| play, pause, skip, set volume, change source, group speakers, browse media, or announce over a speaker | `ha-nova:media` |
| send a notification to a phone or another notify target, or manage Home Assistant's persistent notifications | `ha-nova:notify` |
| look at a camera (snapshot), get a stream URL, or record | `ha-nova:camera` |
| listen to MQTT topics to see what a device actually publishes, inspect MQTT discovery, or publish a message | `ha-nova:mqtt` |
| test what the voice assistant understands, manage Assist pipelines, or control which entities voice can see | `ha-nova:assist` |
| manage persons, zones, tags, or user accounts | `ha-nova:admin` |
| create or edit configuration that only exists as YAML (template/REST/command-line sensors, packages, themes) | `ha-nova:yaml-config` |
| query long-term history from InfluxDB or another external store Home Assistant writes to but cannot read back | `ha-nova:external-sources` |
| list calendars or show calendar events | `ha-nova:calendar` |
| show, add, complete, update, remove to-do or shopping-list items; create/delete to-do lists | `ha-nova:todo` |
| check backup status, create a backup (also as a safety net before risky changes), inspect a backup's contents, delete backups | `ha-nova:backup` |
| check pending updates, read release notes, install updates, skip/unskip versions | `ha-nova:updates` |
| analyze energy usage, solar/battery/grid KPIs, per-device consumption or costs; edit energy dashboard sources/devices | `ha-nova:energy` |
| repair statistics (orphans, unit mismatches, sum spikes), purge recorder history, clean up dead registry entries | `ha-nova:maintenance` |
| turn on/off, toggle, set, call a service | `ha-nova:service-call` |
| enable/disable/trigger an automation | `ha-nova:service-call` |
| find entities by name, room, area | `ha-nova:entity-discovery` |
| fix relay/auth/connectivity errors | `ha-nova:onboarding` |
| undo, revert, or restore the last automation/script/helper change | the skill that wrote it — `ha-nova:write` (automation/script) or `ha-nova:helper` (helper). `revert` applies only to supported verified updates. Creates clean up through the normal delete flow; deletes require Backup/recreate. Run `ha-nova snapshot show` to see the saved target if unsure |
| **any HA task not matched above** — blueprints, unsupported admin writes, any unfamiliar raw relay/ws/core write | `ha-nova:fallback` **(mandatory fallback — never skip)** |

**"Analyze my automation"** → `ha-nova:review` (NOT read + review)
**"Review my utility meter helper"** → `ha-nova:review` (minimal config-entry helper review)
**"Show my automations"** → `ha-nova:read` (NOT review)
**"Show all automations with prefix routine_"** → `ha-nova:entity-discovery` (bulk inventory, not full YAML dump)
**"Create an automation"** → `ha-nova:write` (NOT read + write)
**"Create an input_boolean"** → `ha-nova:helper` (NOT write)
**"Show my helpers"** → `ha-nova:helper` (NOT read)
**"Revert that"** / **"Undo the last change"** → re-invoke the skill that made it: `ha-nova:write` (automation/script) or `ha-nova:helper` (helper). `revert` is update-only and lives there (see `write-safety.md` → Update-Revert), never `ha-nova:fallback`; create cleanup uses delete flow, and delete rollback needs Backup/recreate.
**"Create a scene called Movie Night"** → `ha-nova:scene`
**"Activate the scene Movie Night"** → `ha-nova:service-call` (runtime action, not a config change)
**"Show my main dashboard"** → `ha-nova:dashboard`
**"Create a dashboard called Test Board"** → `ha-nova:dashboard`
**"Delete the Test dashboard"** → `ha-nova:dashboard`
**"Add a markdown card to my dashboard"** → `ha-nova:dashboard`

**"Why is the light turning on at random times?"** → `ha-nova:diagnose`
**"Show me the error log"** → `ha-nova:diagnose`
**"Turn up the volume in the kitchen"** → `ha-nova:media`
**"What's playing in the living room?"** → `ha-nova:media`
**"Announce that dinner is ready"** → `ha-nova:media` (TTS to a speaker)
**"Send me a notification when..."** → `ha-nova:write` (that is an automation, not a one-off send)
**"Send a notification to my phone"** → `ha-nova:notify` (one-off send now)
**"Show me the front door camera"** → `ha-nova:camera`
**"Does Assist understand 'turn on the kitchen light'?"** → `ha-nova:assist` (note: testing it EXECUTES it)
**"Add a zone for work"** → `ha-nova:admin`
**"Create a template sensor that averages my three thermometers"** → `ha-nova:helper` first (a template helper can do it); only `ha-nova:yaml-config` when the helper cannot express it
**"What was the average temperature last summer?"** → `ha-nova:history` if the recorder still has it; `ha-nova:external-sources` when it was purged and InfluxDB has it
**"Is my sensor even sending anything?"** → `ha-nova:mqtt` (listen to its topic); "why did my automation not run" stays `ha-nova:diagnose`
**"Is everything OK with my home?"** → `ha-nova:health` (current status, no concrete incident)
**"Why are devices unavailable?"** → `ha-nova:health`
**"Add milk to my shopping list"** → `ha-nova:todo`
**"What updates are pending?"** → `ha-nova:updates`
**"Update Home Assistant"** → `ha-nova:updates` (offers a safety backup first)
**"When was my last backup?"** → `ha-nova:backup`
**"Make a backup before we change this"** → `ha-nova:backup` (then continue the original task)
**"Restore a backup"** → `ha-nova:backup` explains why restore must run in the HA UI
**"What's on my to-do list?"** → `ha-nova:todo`
**"Show my calendars"** → `ha-nova:calendar`
**"What's on my calendar this week?"** → `ha-nova:calendar`
**"Review all automations in area Area Alpha"** → `ha-nova:review` (area-first aggregate review when more than one target resolves)
**"Create a timer"** → ambiguous! Ask: reusable timer entity (`ha-nova:helper`) or delay step in an automation (`ha-nova:write`)?
**"How much energy did the dryer use last month?"** → `ha-nova:energy`
**"Add this plug to the energy dashboard"** → `ha-nova:energy`
**"Fix the spike in my energy graph"** → `ha-nova:maintenance`
**"Clean up orphaned statistics"** → `ha-nova:maintenance`
**"Import a blueprint"** → `ha-nova:fallback` (relay-ready, no skill)
**"How do I manage Apps?"** → `ha-nova:fallback` (external, web search)
**"Show history for sensor X"** → `ha-nova:history`
**"Modify my dashboard"** → `ha-nova:dashboard`
**"Save the Lovelace config"** → `ha-nova:dashboard` (must resolve storage mode, then read-merge-verify)
**"Remove this entity from Home Assistant"** → `ha-nova:maintenance` (dead registry entries only; live entities get disabled via `ha-nova:organize`)
**"Detach this config entry from the device"** → `ha-nova:fallback`

After any `read` or `review` task, re-evaluate intent once before continuing:
- config change on automation/script → `ha-nova:write`
- helper change → `ha-nova:helper`
- pass along the resolved identifiers needed by the next skill:
  - automation/script: `entity_id`, `unique_id`, current config
  - helper:
    - storage-based family: `entity_id`, helper type, internal helper id when already known (the receiving skill will resolve missing fields)
    - config-entry family: `entry_id`, domain, title, linked entities when already known (the receiving skill will resolve missing fields)
- always pass along the requested change
- keep this sequential: one skill at a time, never parallel
- for multi-target scope, keep the same safety and evidence rules; see `skills/ha-nova/bulk-patterns.md`

**Problem-description intents** ("X doesn't work", "Y is wrong", "stopped working", "didn't fire last night"): dispatch to `ha-nova:diagnose` — a concrete failure is a root-cause task (traces, error/system logs, bounded windows), regardless of whether the user literally says "why". Diagnose hands the fix back to `write` / `helper` / `service-call`.

Dispatch to `ha-nova:review` instead when there is no concrete incident: config-quality audits ("check my automations", "review this script", "is this a good automation?"). Review analyzes the config AND checks current entity state — if an acute fix is possible, it offers a Quick-Fix service call at the end. Bulk review is the exception: it stays read-only and does not offer Quick-Fix.

## Latency Policy

- Prefer one-shot reads over multi-step probing.
- For first read/list, try Relay `/ws` directly.
- For write flows, keep main-thread file reads minimal:
  - context skill (this file)
  - `skills/ha-nova/bulk-patterns.md` only for multi-target discovery/review work
  - `skills/ha-nova/relay-api.md`
  - one agent template per phase
- No proactive doctor in success path.
- Re-read full state snapshot only with explicit reason.
