# HA NOVA Updates

## Scope

Lifecycle:
- grouped overview of pending updates
- release notes/links for one update
- install an update (feature-gated, safety gates)
- skip/unskip versions

Not in scope:
- auto-update settings: HA UI
- HACS store operations beyond `update.*` entities (`ha-nova:hacs`)
- rollbacks: not downgradable (HACS downgrades: `ha-nova:hacs`); recovery is a Home Assistant Backup

## Bootstrap (once per session)

Read and follow `../ha-nova/session-bootstrap.md`.
Verify relay CLI: `ha-nova relay health`
If this fails: `ha-nova setup`

## Relay Contract

File-based requests: `ha-nova relay core --method <METHOD> --path <PATH> --body-file <payload-file>` and `ha-nova relay ws --data-file <payload-file>`; `--out <result-file>` for large responses.
REST body: `.data.body`; WS body: `.data` (`skills/ha-nova/relay-api.md` → Standard Envelope).

## Feature Gate (critical)

Read `supported_features` before acting:

| Bit | Feature |
|---|---|
| 1 | install |
| 2 | install a specific version |
| 4 | progress reporting |
| 8 | backup before update (App/core mechanism) |
| 16 | release notes |

Never call a bitmask-backed service (install/version/backup/release-notes) the mask does not allow — name the missing capability. Skip/unskip have no bits; their only gate is `auto_update` (see Skip).

## Flow

### Overview
`GET /api/states --out <result-file>` for the update entities AND WS `{"type":"config/entity_registry/list"}` for their `platform`/`unique_id` (states alone cannot classify). Filter `update.*`, report grouped, pending (`state: "on"`) first:
- Home Assistant stack: core, operating system, supervisor
- Apps; integrations (HACS components); device firmware (everything else)
Group deterministically: `platform: hacs` = integrations; `platform: hassio` splits by `unique_id` — `home_assistant_{core,os,supervisor}_version_latest` = HA stack, `<addon_slug>_version_latest` = App; everything else = device firmware/other. Never guess from names.
NOVA Relay requires exactly `platform: hassio` plus `unique_id: 2368fcfa_ha_nova_relay_version_latest`; names insufficient.
Per pending item: name, `installed_version` → `latest_version`, `auto_update`, `skipped_version`. Fleets: counts per group + pending list only — never dump 200 firmware rows.

### Release notes
Bit 16 set: WS `{"type":"update/release_notes","entity_id":"update.<id>"}` → markdown in `.data`; summarize, never dump. Without bit 16, do not call it (it fails with `not_supported`) — use the entity's `release_summary`/`release_url` instead; when both are empty, say no notes are available.

### Install
1. Feature Gate: bit 1 required. Preview one update: name, versions, release-notes summary or link.
2. Safety gates by kind:
   - **core / operating system**: far-reaching — offer a full safety backup first via `ha-nova:backup` and say that HA restarts during the update. Surface breaking-changes sections first; for skipped-version jumps link intermediate releases via `release_url`. Honor named OS/Supervisor prerequisites first.
   - **Apps**: with bit 8, include `"backup": true`. NOVA Relay restarts mid-call; use step 6's target/entity/ping/post-health verification. Its entity lacks bit 2: preview latest and omit `version`.
   - **supervisor**: usually updates itself (`auto_update`); an explicit install restarts the Supervisor — expect a brief entity dropout during the poll, no HA restart.
   - **integrations (HACS components)**: before ANY install — single or batched — read the HACS repository info: a set `selected_tag` (pin/downgrade) STOPS the install here; pin overrides are explicit per-item decisions in `ha-nova:hacs`, never an `update.install` side effect. The same stop applies to any EXPLICIT version target on a `platform: hacs` entity (older or specific version, pinned or not): hand it to `ha-nova:hacs` — a generic `update.install` with `"version"` would download once without the HACS preview/read-back and without the persistent-pin step. This skill installs only the latest for HACS entities. Surface breaking-changes sections from their release notes like core — HACS components break often, a one-line summary is not enough. The new version loads only after a Home Assistant restart — after a verified install, report it as installed but not yet active, and offer the restart as a separate confirmed step via `ha-nova:service-call`.
   - **device firmware**: warn that firmware updates can take long, must not be interrupted, and rarely have release notes — confirm the exact device.
3. Natural confirmation bound to this preview (context skill → Active Preview Confirmation). One update per confirmation. For "update everything", confirm the batch explicitly, then install sequentially, verifying each before the next. Order Apps and firmware before core/OS because a restart pauses later work.
   Since HA 2026.7 the Updates page groups pending updates with per-group "Update all" buttons — that is ONE multi-target `update.install` (an entity_id list; no new API), which runs all installs CONCURRENTLY, sets NO backup flag, surfaces only the FIRST failure, and never includes core/OS/Supervisor. This skill deliberately does NOT mirror that call shape — sequential installs with per-item verification and backup gates stay. Mirror its guardrails instead: the HA system stack is never part of the one batch confirmation (each of those stays its own confirmed step with its own gates), and skipped or `in_progress` entities never ride along. HACS integrations in a batch all stay installed-but-not-active — collect them and offer ONE restart at the end instead of one per item. Pinned HACS repositories still report as pending (`selected_tag` never suppresses update signaling): before batching any `platform: hacs` entity, read its HACS repository info and EXCLUDE repositories with a `selected_tag` — a pin override is an explicit per-item decision through `ha-nova:hacs`, never a batch side effect.
4. Immediately before POST, re-read state and registry. Require the confirmed `entity_id`, `platform`, `unique_id`, `installed_version`, `latest_version`, and `supported_features`, with `in_progress` false. For NOVA Relay, re-require that exact pair. Any drift invalidates confirmation: stop, show the new preview, and reconfirm.
5. POST `/api/services/update/install` with `{"entity_id":"update.<id>"}` (+ `"backup": true` for App updates; for core/OS pass it ONLY when the confirmed preview explicitly included that built-in backup — the offered `ha-nova:backup` flow is the safety net, never an unconditional flag; + the confirmed `"version": "<v>"` only with bit 2).
6. The call returns before the update finishes. Poll the entity: `in_progress`/`update_percentage` while running; done when `installed_version` equals the target — for latest-version installs additionally `state: off`; an explicitly requested older version may legitimately leave the entity pending.
   - **NOVA Relay**: poll health every ~5 s for 3 minutes until its observed version reaches the offered target and skills' minimum. Timeout means not verified: do not probe or claim readiness. Then require the update entity complete (`installed_version` reaches target, `state: off`, `in_progress: false`), send WS `{"type":"ping"}`, and re-read health. Pre-ping `false`/`never_connected`/`network` is passive or stale — never diagnose it alone. Success requires ping `ok: true` and post-ping `ha_ws_connected: true`; otherwise classify the WS error and post-health reason.
   - **core / operating system**: connection and `UPSTREAM_*` errors during the poll ARE the expected restart window, not failure. Keep polling every ~30 s (core up to ~15 min; OS longer — the host reboots and the relay itself is unreachable) and never route to `ha-nova setup` mid-update.
   - **long-running updates**: if still `in_progress` after ~10 minutes (device firmware: 30+ minutes and a temporarily `unavailable` device are normal), say it continues in the background and how to check later. Report failure when `state` stays `on` without progress — never claim success from the call alone.

### Skip / unskip
- Skip a pending version: POST `/api/services/update/skip` with `{"entity_id":"update.<id>"}` — preview which version gets skipped; natural confirmation; verify by re-reading the entity (`skipped_version` set, `state: off`). Reversible. HA rejects skip/clear_skipped on `auto_update: true` entities — say so instead of calling.
- Undo: POST `/api/services/update/clear_skipped` — the update shows as pending again.

## Error Handling

- `not_supported` on release notes: expected without bit 16 — use `release_url`.
- Install rejected: report HA's error, no blind retry — a running update (`in_progress`) blocks a second install.
- Entity vanished mid-poll: re-read once; NOVA Relay uses the health-poll window above.
- Full relay error taxonomy: `skills/ha-nova/relay-api.md` → Error Handling.

## Output Format

Apply `skills/ha-nova/output-rules.md`. Write previews, delete confirmations, and results render as the Cards defined there.

- `Updates` / `Status`
- `Planned change`
- `Options`
- `Verification`
- `Next step`

Use stable localized slot labels in this order; omit empty slots. The overview renders the Report shape; pending lists render the List Frame (group counts + capped pending list) — never raw JSON.

## Safety

- Preview before write: nothing is saved until the user confirms the shown preview.
- Confirmation binds to the displayed preview and expires on any change to target, payload, endpoint, or scope (context skill → Active Preview Confirmation).
- Pre-preview phrases ("do it", "go ahead", "implement the plan") authorize drafting and preview only — never the write itself.
- Delete and destructive operations require the typed confirmation code `confirm:<token>` verbatim; "yes" or any natural-language reply is invalid.
- Never guess entity, service, or config IDs — resolve them or ask.
- Home Assistant is reached exclusively through `ha-nova relay`.
- For any HA write this skill does not cover, STOP and invoke `ha-nova:fallback` first — never probe unfamiliar write endpoints.

- Drafts follow `skills/ha-nova/smallest-solution.md`: the complete requested outcome in the simplest safe design, nothing for hypothetical future needs.

- Installs: natural confirmation per update after preview; batches need an explicitly confirmed plan.
- Updates are effectively irreversible — for core/OS name the safety-backup offer before, not after.
- Never install anything the user did not ask about or confirm; `auto_update: true` items update themselves — say so instead of installing them unprompted; an explicit, confirmed user request may still install.
- Verify by re-reading the entity.
