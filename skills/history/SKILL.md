# HA NOVA History


## Scope

Read-only timeline work:
- entity state history over a bounded time range
- logbook queries over a bounded time range
- long-term statistics over a bounded time range
- concise "what happened?" summaries

Not in scope:
- live subscriptions
- system logs
- trace debugging
- calendar queries (use `ha-nova:calendar`)
- giant raw exports

Use `ha-nova:diagnose` for traces (it owns trace analysis; `ha-nova:read` only surfaces raw trace data when the user explicitly asks for it with no failure question attached), `ha-nova:calendar` for calendars, and `ha-nova:fallback` for subscriptions.

## Bootstrap (once per session)

Read and follow `../ha-nova/session-bootstrap.md`.
Verify relay CLI: `ha-nova relay health`
If this fails: `ha-nova setup`

## Relay Contract

Use file-based relay requests:
- `ha-nova relay core --method GET --path <history-path> --out <result-file>`
- `ha-nova relay core --method GET --path <logbook-path> --out <result-file>`
- `ha-nova relay ws --data-file <payload-file> --out <result-file>`
- `ha-nova relay jq --file <result-file> --jq-file <filter-file>`

For `ha-nova relay jq`, the filter is positional unless `--jq-file` is used. Do not invent a `--jq` flag.

Canonical paths:
- `/api/history/period/<start>?filter_entity_id=<entity_id>&end_time=<end>`
- `/api/logbook/<start>?entity=<entity_id>&end_time=<end>` — `entity` takes a
  comma-separated LIST for several entities (verified on 2026.8.0: the endpoint
  splits on commas and ignores unknown ids), and omitting it entirely returns
  the whole home for that window. `filter_entity_id` belongs to the HISTORY
  endpoint; using it here silently returns everything.
- `recorder/statistics_during_period`

Prefer `minimal_response` and `no_attributes` on large history queries when the task only needs state transitions.
Envelope parsing follows `skills/ha-nova/relay-api.md` → Standard Envelope; relay-core response shape here stays under `.data.body`.
- history series: `.data.body[0]`
- logbook entries: `.data.body`
- do not probe `.[0]` or `.[0][0]` against the relay envelope
Recorder statistics response stays under WS `.data`.

Statistics semantics (`recorder/statistics_during_period`) — check which keys the response actually carries before summarizing:
- Measurement stats (temperature, humidity) carry `mean`/`min`/`max`. Metered `total_increasing` stats (energy, water, gas) are consumption: request `change` in the `types` list and SUM the per-bucket `change` values over the window (the pattern `skills/energy/energy-reference.md` uses) — never an average, and never `last sum − first sum`, which drops the first bucket's consumption and reads 0 for a single bucket.
- Long-term statistics carry their own unit, which can differ from the entity's current unit after a unit change (the exact trap `ha-nova:maintenance` repairs) — report the unit from the statistics metadata, and flag a mismatch instead of mixing units.
- `statistic_id` is not always an `entity_id`: external statistics use `domain:object_id` (colon) and have no entity — resolve via `recorder/list_statistic_ids` when unsure.
- Daily/monthly buckets follow the HA server's local timezone including DST shifts — a "day" is not a fixed 24 h; name the bucket timezone when precision matters.
- The queried window is what was REQUESTED, not what was observed: report the actual first-to-last sample span and material gaps alongside the requested window, and never phrase a result as covering "the last N days" when the evidence spans less (`skills/ha-nova/write-safety.md` → Time-Window Evidence — applies to raw history summaries too). For `recorder/statistics_during_period` the response carries aggregated period BUCKETS, not sample timestamps: report the first-to-last bucket span and NAME it as bucket coverage — sample density claims come only from raw state history, never from LTS buckets.

## Flow

1. Resolve the exact entity target when needed.
2. Set a bounded window.
   - if the user gave a range, use it
   - otherwise default to the last 24 hours for history/logbook
   - otherwise default to the last 30 days for statistics/trend questions
   - if the requested window is too broad, narrow it before querying
3. Choose the source:
   - history for state transitions and values
   - logbook for human-readable events and automation activity
   - statistics for multi-day trends, comparisons, or long-term summaries
4. Execute the read into `<result-file>`.
5. Summarize first:
   - key transitions
   - first/last seen values
   - notable gaps or bursts
   - key periods or trend direction for statistics
   - if the raw state series can contain `unknown` or `unavailable`, do not run numeric min/max across the whole series unless you first filter to numeric states safely
   - prefer simple reductions that do not depend on fragile timestamp parsing unless the user explicitly asked for gap analysis
   - for the default summary, do not build complex jq expressions just to recover min/max event timestamps; numeric range plus a few direct sample timestamps is enough
6. Only show raw excerpts if the user explicitly asks.

## Output Format

Apply `skills/ha-nova/output-rules.md` to all user-facing output.

- `Target`
- `Window`
- `Summary`
- `Key events`, `Key transitions`, or `Key periods`
- `Next step`

These slots render the Report shape (output-rules.md). Keep default output compact. Raw payload dumps are opt-in only.

## Safety

- Read-only skill: never issue mutating relay or service calls.
- For write intent, hand off to the owning skill; unfamiliar writes go through `ha-nova:fallback` first.

- Read-only skill. No writes.
- No guessed entity ids.
- If more than one entity could match, ask one blocking question.
- If the data is incomplete for the requested conclusion, say so explicitly.

Whole-home and multi-entity windows: omitting `entity` from the logbook path
returns everything that happened ("what happened overnight?") — allowed for
windows up to 24 hours, summary-first, never a raw dump. For a small explicit
set, pass the ids as a comma-separated `entity` value on that LOGBOOK path —
verified against 2026.8.0: the endpoint splits on commas, and an unknown id in
the list is ignored rather than failing the query.
`filter_entity_id` belongs to the history endpoint, and using it here silently
returns the whole home instead. That is how you compare two people's arrival
times in one call.

## Guardrails

- Never run an unbounded history/logbook/statistics query.
- Cap default history/logbook windows at 24 hours unless the user asked for more; statistics/trend questions keep the Flow's 30-day default.
- If the user asks for a very large export, narrow the request first.
- Prefer a short summary over dumping a long raw timeline.
