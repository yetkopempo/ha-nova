"""compress-cast.py — tighten a real asciinema recording without faking it.

Approach: a uniform time-lapse toward --target seconds, with driver-declared
protection. The recording driver logs its own typing windows (epoch pairs in
<cast>.protect, written by lib.sh) — those keep their natural cadence, and
intervals right after a content marker (preview card, options line, result
card) keep a reading hold. Everything else — thinking pauses, spinner phases,
tool latency, streamed output — is scaled uniformly. Every frame shown really
happened; only time shrinks. (Content-based busy-detection was tried first
and lost: spinner tick shapes and periodic full repaints vary too much across
claude versions to classify reliably. The spinner also ticks ~10x/s, so
interval-length heuristics cannot tell thinking from typing.)

Also:
- E-mail addresses are redacted byte-level (ANSI-sequence-aware — a naive
  regex eats SGR terminators and garbles the replay; verified). The claude
  welcome header prints the account e-mail and survives every repaint.
- The tail is cut in event space: everything from the typed "/exit" onwards
  (teardown, resume screen) is dropped. Trailing cuts are safe; LEADING cuts
  drop terminal-state setup later bytes depend on and garble the replay.
- Emits <out>.markers.json with post-compression timestamps for render.sh
  (camera picture-in-picture timing).
- A final no-op event is appended: asciinema play can swallow the very last
  event's rendering otherwise.
