//
//   1. Honesty guarantees that docs/reference/safety.md cites a test for,
//      where the cited test does not actually assert them. A green suite plus
//      a promise in the safety table is worse than an honest gap.
//   2. Gates whose deletion would silently downgrade a tier or lose data,
//      ranked by what regressing them costs the user.
