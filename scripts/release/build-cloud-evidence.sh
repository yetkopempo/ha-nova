# Mechanics for the Home Assistant Cloud evidence envelope — never the attestation.
#
# The envelope binds to a PR's synthetic merge tree, so every merge into main
# needs a fresh one (docs/releasing.md -> "Home Assistant Cloud publication
# gate"). Doing that by hand is ~20 steps across three machines, and both real
# incidents happened in exactly the mechanical steps: #559 set only one of the
# two secret locations and main went red seconds after the squash merge; #560
# left the envelope pointing at the discarded synthetic merge commit and every
# later PR failed the gate. This script owns the mechanics and refuses the
# judgement:
#
#   resolve the exact target   refs/pull/<pr>/merge -> commit, tree, relay version
#   bind the candidate run     request_id derived from the target commit
#   verify the download        sha256 over the artifact's own checksum files
#   prove identity FIRST       every bundle's embedded manifest must match the
#                              target before any candidate binary executes
#   run provenance             one internal-cloud-release-check per enabled
#                              platform, fail-closed: an unreachable host or a
#                              failed run is a hard stop, never a skip
#   move the secret            BOTH locations (repository secret AND production
#                              environment), both updated_at verified after
#   repoint after the merge    --repoint: same tree, renamed to the main commit
#
# It never writes a check boolean into the secret. checks/keyrings values come
# exclusively from the maintainer's envelope file (--envelope), validated
# mechanically against the gate contract and this exact target. The
# qualification decision and the PR ledger stay with the maintainer
# (docs/work/2026-07-30-cloud-release-evidence-risk-scope-spec.md).

# request_id is a REQUIRED dispatch input, derived deterministically for the
# audit trail — but binding never relies on it: every run before the #574
# fix is titled just "Cloud candidate PR" (the unquoted `#` in run-name
# started a YAML comment), and `gh run list` cannot filter by dispatch
# inputs either way. Binding works with what the API reliably has:
#   - an in-flight run is watched to completion FIRST — dispatching would
#     cancel it via the per-PR concurrency group, and in this
#     single-maintainer repo it is almost certainly ours;
#   - the newest completed success is only a REUSE CANDIDATE: its artifact
#     must prove this exact target (embedded bundle version + tree) before
#     anything trusts it, else we dispatch;
#   - a dispatched run is bound as "the workflow_dispatch run that appeared
#     above the highest run id seen before the dispatch".
# A wrong pick can never attest anything: identity is proven from local bytes
# before any binary executes, and check_identity guards every provenance run.
