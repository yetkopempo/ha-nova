# Verify the release pipeline contract.
#
# Two layers:
#   1. Static workflow invariants every release depends on (no GitHub
#      permissions; runs in CI and locally).
#   2. The live GitHub production-environment and tag-ruleset state that keeps
#      production secrets on main/v* and makes release tags maintainer-pushed.
#
# The live layer auto-skips entirely with a notice when the current token cannot
# read rulesets at all (e.g. a token with no repo access), so the same script
# serves both as a maintainer preflight command and as the weekly audit.
# Verifying the no-App-bypass guard additionally needs *write* access to the
# ruleset — GitHub only returns bypass_actors to requesters with write access.
# When the token can read the ruleset but not bypass_actors (e.g. the default CI
# GITHUB_TOKEN), the no-App-bypass guard is skipped with a notice so the weekly
# audit stays green; the release preflight sets
# HA_NOVA_RELEASE_AUDIT_REQUIRE_BYPASS=1 to make that case fail closed instead.
#
# Background: the v0.5.0 release exposed two pipeline traps — a GoReleaser tag
# auto-detection footgun when an rc tag and the final tag share a commit, and
# an RC workflow that tried to publish via a path the tag ruleset blocks. This
# check pins both so they cannot silently come back.
