# HA NOVA Skill Architecture

## Overview

HA NOVA uses a flat skill layout with one context skill and 11 independent sub-skills under `skills/`.

The repo skill tree is the single source of truth. Client installers adapt that same tree to each client's packaging rules:
- Claude: plugin marketplace payload
- Codex / OpenCode: nested skill tree
- Gemini: flat copied skill directories
- Hermes: namespaced nested copied skill tree with directory names aligned to installed skill IDs

Installed skill tree:
```

  entity-discovery/SKILL.md             (ha-nova:entity-discovery — entity lookup)
  service-call/SKILL.md                 (ha-nova:service-call — service calls + runtime control)
  fallback/SKILL.md                     (ha-nova:fallback — mandatory fallback for relay-ready features)
  onboarding/SKILL.md                   (ha-nova:onboarding — onboarding + diagnostics)
```

## Discovery Model

The canonical skill entrypoints remain `skills/*/SKILL.md`.

- Claude loads HA NOVA through the installed plugin marketplace payload.
- Codex and OpenCode load the nested `ha-nova` skill tree directly.
- Gemini receives flat copied skill directories because it only supports one skill level.
- Gemini sub-skills are installed with namespaced identifiers such as `ha-nova-entity-discovery` so the flat folder names and activation names stay aligned.
- Hermes receives a nested copied `ha-nova` bundle under `~/.hermes/skills/ha-nova`, with namespaced sub-skill directories such as `ha-nova-entity-discovery/` whose directory names and frontmatter names stay identical.

The context skill (`ha-nova`) stays the stable entrypoint; sub-skills remain independently discoverable by description and naming.

## Repo-local Hook Note

`hooks/session-start` still exists as a repo-local development helper, but it is **not** the production installation model for Claude. Production Claude installs use a versioned local release snapshot under `~/.config/ha-nova/claude-marketplace/releases/vX.Y.Z`. The flat local staged marketplace layout stays a repo-local development tool only.

## Agent vs Inline Decision Rule

When building a new skill, decide execution model by these criteria:

**Use agents when ALL of these apply:**
- 5+ relay calls in a single operation
- Multi-step deterministic logic (resolve with fallback, write with normalization)
- Nested payload structures requiring comparison/normalization (e.g., trigger/triggers aliasing)
- Domain reload required after write

**Use inline when ANY of these apply:**
- 1-4 relay calls per operation
- Flat payloads (no nested triggers/conditions/actions)
- Direct user interaction needed between steps (preview → confirm → execute)
- No payload normalization quirks

Current mapping:

| Skill | Model | Why |
|-------|-------|-----|
| read | inline | 1-2 calls, direct output |
| write | **agents** | 5-7 calls, entity resolution fallback, singular/plural normalization, domain reload |
| helper | inline | response-driven relay flows, direct preview/confirm loop, no agent-only normalization requirement |
| dashboard | inline | read → merge → preview → full-save → readback verify, all user-facing |
| organize | inline | field-level registry mutations with direct preview/readback |
| history | inline | read-only bounded timeline lookups |
| review | inline | analysis is client-side, relay calls are reads only |
| entity-discovery | inline | 1-2 calls, search + return |
| service-call | inline | 2-3 calls, preview + execute |
| fallback | inline | research + web search + experimental relay calls (write-guarded) |
| onboarding | inline | diagnostics only |

**Rule of thumb:** If a `service-call` could do it, it's inline. If it needs what `write` needs (resolve + normalize + reload), use agents.

## Write Architecture

`ha-nova:write` uses a deterministic four-phase flow:

1. Resolve (Agent)
- load env
- fetch states
- resolve entities and target id
- check existence + current config
- evaluate best-practice snapshot status

2. Preview + Decide (Main Thread)
- build final payload
- show compact preview blocks
- ask one decision question only if ambiguous
- confirmation tier:
  - create/update: natural confirmation bound to active preview
  - delete: tokenized `confirm:<token>`

3. Apply + Verify (Agent)
- write via relay `/core`
- read-back verification
- normalized compare (`trigger(s)`, `condition(s)`, `action(s)`)
- structured error result on partial or failed verification

4. Review (inline, do NOT invoke `ha-nova:review` as separate skill)
- post-write config quality checks, collision scan, conflict analysis
- findings are advisory (write already succeeded)

Fallback:
- if agent dispatch unavailable, execute same phases inline serially.

## Read Architecture

`ha-nova:read` is intentionally direct/low-overhead:
- no subagent dispatch for routine reads
- `/ws config/entity_registry/list_for_display` for list operations
- `/core` config reads for single-item get operations
- one blocking question only if target ambiguity remains
- multi-target scope is inventory-only; use the shared bulk selector rules from `skills/ha-nova/bulk-patterns.md`
- room/area bulk resolution is area-first: resolve the area, then use `search/related` on the area response object instead of assuming compact-registry `ai` is populated
- do not dump full YAML for many targets in one response

## Dashboard Architecture

`ha-nova:dashboard` owns safe storage-dashboard work:
- list dashboards
- read one dashboard config
- list Lovelace resources
- inspect dashboard structure (views, cards, badges, header cards)
- create a storage dashboard shell
- update dashboard metadata
- create/update/delete Lovelace resources
- add/update/move/delete cards inside existing views
- delete a storage dashboard

Write contract:
- resolve `dashboard_id`, `url_path`, and `mode` through `lovelace/dashboards/list`
- only `mode=storage` may be created/updated/deleted here
- metadata changes go through `lovelace/dashboards/create|update|delete`
- metadata update sends `dashboard_id` plus only changed metadata fields: `title`, `icon`, `show_in_sidebar`, `require_admin`
- `dashboard_id` is the mutation identifier for `update|delete`; `url_path` is the config identifier for `lovelace/config|save`
- resource CRUD goes through `lovelace/resources|create|update|delete`
- content edits always read the current full config first
- resolve the exact target card/badge/header by view + title/entity/type/position before changing it
- merge in memory
- preview the merged result
- save through `lovelace/config/save` with the full config only
- read back and verify the intended change plus unrelated-view survival

Still excluded:
- broad raw Lovelace editing without a concrete requested change
- view create/delete/reorder
- non-storage dashboard writes/deletes
- freeform new custom-card creation
- energy dashboard preferences

## Organize Architecture

`ha-nova:organize` owns metadata-first Home Assistant organization:
- areas / floors / labels / categories CRUD
- entity registry metadata updates
- entity category assignment/removal by scope
- device registry metadata updates

Mutation rules:
- exact target resolution first
- every `config/category_registry/*` call includes the exact `scope`
- rich metadata stays first-class:
  - areas: `floor_id`, `icon`, `picture`, `aliases`
  - floors: `level`, `icon`, `aliases`
  - labels: `color`, `icon`, `description`
  - categories: `icon`
- entity/device label updates may replace, add, remove, or clear labels
- field-level preview before write
- destructive area/floor/label/category delete requires impact preview + token confirmation
- read back the changed registry fields after every mutation

Still excluded:
- entity removal
- device config-entry detachment
- device category assignment
- zones / persons / tags

## History Architecture

`ha-nova:history` is a bounded read-only timeline skill:
- entity history via `/api/history/period`
- human-readable timeline via `/api/logbook`
- long-term trends via `recorder/statistics_during_period`
- summary-first answers

Rules:
- always use a bounded time window
- prefer concise summaries over raw dumps
- reject or narrow oversized requests

## Review Architecture

`ha-nova:review` is a self-contained read-only reviewer:
- Config quality: safety (S-01..S-03), reliability (R-01..R-20), performance (P-01..P-05), style (M-01..M-04), script-specific (F-01..F-08), helper-specific (H-01..H-10)
- Collision scan: `search/related` on top 3 target entities
- Conflict analysis: 3-step test (polarity → temporal → guard conditions)
- Explorative questions: standalone automation/script reviews add a gated edge-case pass for complex behavior
- Suggestion synthesis: standalone single-target review splits uncertainty into **Questions to consider** and keeps only confident recommendations in **Suggestions**
- Remove/simplify ideas pass a design-intent gate before they can become confident suggestions
- Confident suggestions are ranked by intervention depth: fix existing → simplify existing → extend existing → add new
- User-facing review text never shows internal rule codes; findings use a short descriptive title plus `Why` and `Fix`, and clean states stay generic
- `R-17` is intra-config only; collision scan stays cross-item conflict work, not overwrite/rebound detection
- `R-18` is same-mapping only; it checks storage-sensitive sibling-variable references inside one `variables:` block, not cross-scope references
- `R-19` is branch-structure reachability only; it covers direct `trigger.id` checks in a terminal bare `else` after entity-state `if` / `elif` guards, without intent inference
- `R-20` is conjunction-scope contradiction only; it covers mutually exclusive fixed `condition: state` requirements on the same entity inside one implicit or explicit `AND` scope
- Known safe/problem pattern matching from `skills/review/checks.md`
- resolved targets `== 1`: stable 8-section single-target output (`Review target`, `Findings`, `Collision check`, `Conflicts`, `Questions to consider`, `Suggestions`, `Summary`, `Instant help`)
- resolved targets `> 1`: switch to aggregate multi-target mode automatically, materialize and trim the current workset before any per-item reads, audit max 5 items in stable order, aggregate findings by pattern, and report `matched / audited / remaining`
- bulk mode disables Quick-Fix; it stays strictly read-only
- post-write review stays compact and keeps the advisory-only `Findings` / `Collision check` / `Advisory` structure

## Helper Architecture

`ha-nova:helper` now has two explicit helper families:

- **Storage-based family**
  - Types: `input_boolean`, `input_number`, `input_text`, `input_select`, `input_datetime`, `input_button`, `counter`, `timer`, `schedule`
  - Transport: WS (`{type}/create`, `{type}/update`, `{type}/delete`)
  - Identity: `{type}_id` from `{type}/list`, not entity_id
  - Write verify: `{type}/list`
  - Review: H-01..H-10 helper-specific checks + collision scan via `search/related`
  - No domain reload needed

- **Config-entry family**
  - Types: `utility_meter`, `derivative`, `integration`, `min_max`, `threshold`, `tod`, `statistics`, `group`, `history_stats`
  - Read/list: WS `config_entries/get` + WS `config/entity_registry/list`
  - Readback: current editable options snapshot when `supports_options: true`; metadata-only fallback otherwise
  - Mutation transport: relay `/core`
  - Create: config-entry flow loop, including menu/form step iteration
  - Update: options-flow loop with required-field carry-forward from the current editable options snapshot
  - Identity: `entry_id` is canonical; linked `entity_id` values are derived only
  - Write verify: config-entry layer first for identity/existence, reopened editable options snapshot for field-level update verification
  - Review: minimal config-entry post-write contract, not H-01..H-10
  - `group` remains menu-driven; end-to-end support is proven for the `sensor` subtype, and other subtypes must stay anchored to the live step schema instead of guessed fields

Still excluded from `ha-nova:helper`:
- `template`
- `trend`
- `random`
- `filter`
- `generic_thermostat`
- `switch_as_x`
- `generic_hygrostat`

## Fallback Architecture

`ha-nova:fallback` is the mandatory safety fallback for HA features without a dedicated skill:
- Covers: blueprints, zones/persons/tags, energy, calendars, system health, destructive registry admin, unsupported config-entry helper families
- Three-tier capability map: Covered (redirect to existing skill), Relay-Ready (experimental relay calls), External (web search)
- All inline, no agents — research + web search + experimental relay calls
- Safety: all experimental relay calls follow Write Safety by Endpoint Type guardrails (full-overwrite, field-level replace, merge, delete)

## Dev Installer Contract

The remaining shell-adjacent scripts are a development/compatibility surface, not a second product lifecycle.

Active dev helpers:
- `scripts/onboarding/install-local-skills.sh`
- `scripts/onboarding/bin/ha-nova`
- `scripts/dev-sync.sh`

Rules for this helper family:
- no end-user installer contract
- no product lifecycle logic beyond runtime discovery and forwarding
- no Git/network self-update flow
- keep behavior narrow: local skill refresh, local cache refresh, runtime forwarding, or pre-Go compatibility only

`scripts/onboarding/install-local-skills.sh` is the main repo-local installer helper.
`npm run dev:sync` / `scripts/dev-sync.sh` is the canonical repo-local refresh helper once a local install already exists.

It handles repo-local skill refreshes for development and validation:
- source skill tree: `skills/` (repo-local, flat layout)
- client-specific install strategies:
  - **Claude Code:** for repo-local development only, stages a local marketplace root under `~/.config/ha-nova/claude-marketplace`, registers it with `claude plugin marketplace add`, then installs/reinstalls `ha-nova@ha-nova`
  - **Codex CLI:** symlink on Unix, copy fallback on Windows at `~/.agents/skills/ha-nova`
  - **OpenCode:** symlink on Unix, copy fallback on Windows at `~/.config/opencode/skills/ha-nova`
  - **Gemini CLI:** Flat copy `~/.gemini/skills/ha-nova-*/SKILL.md` (1-level limit), with namespaced sub-skill names matching those folder names
  - **Hermes Agent:** Namespaced nested copy under `~/.hermes/skills/ha-nova/ha-nova-*`, with sub-skill directory names and frontmatter names both using the same `ha-nova-*` identifier
- cleans up legacy flat skill directories (old `ha-nova-*` prefixed dirs)
- supports targets: `codex`, `claude`, `opencode`, `gemini`, `hermes`, `all`

The other helper roles are intentionally smaller:
- `scripts/onboarding/bin/ha-nova` forwards repo-local setup/update/check-update calls into the Go runtime
- repo/dev compatibility wrappers such as `~/.config/ha-nova/version-check` are generated from `scripts/onboarding/install-local-skills.sh` or `scripts/dev-sync.sh`, not tracked as standalone repo scripts
- `scripts/dev-sync.sh` refreshes detected local client installs and Claude cache state during development

The end-user installer contract is:
- `install.sh` / `install.ps1` bootstrap the runtime, handle legacy gating, and hand off into `ha-nova setup`
- `ha-nova setup` owns product setup, migration, and client attachment
- bundled Claude installs attach to a versioned local release snapshot under `~/.config/ha-nova/claude-marketplace/releases/vX.Y.Z`; the flat `~/.config/ha-nova/claude-marketplace` root stays repo/dev-only

## Skill Section Template

Standard sections for all sub-skills. Follow this when creating or auditing skills.

**Required for ALL skills:**
- **Scope** — what this skill does + inverse scope (what it does NOT do, which skill to use instead)
- **Bootstrap** — relay CLI verification + onboarding fallback
- **Flow** — step-by-step operations with relay commands
- **Output Format** — what the user receives (structure, content)
- **Safety** — risk mitigations, confirmation rules, relay-only constraint
- **Guardrails** — limits, constraints, "never use raw `get_states`"

**Required for MUTATION skills** (write, helper):
- **Post-Write Review** — mandatory inline review after every create/update/delete
- **References** — links to schema docs, relay API, review checks

**Optional:**
- **Error Handling** — error classification + remediation (recommended for external calls)
- **Latency Policy** — when to optimize for speed

## Post-Write Review Standard

Unified spec for post-write review. Both `write` and `helper` skills reference this.

After any mutation (automation, script, or helper):
1. Re-read written config via relay
2. Enter via `skills/review/SKILL.md` Step 1 and load the detailed checks from `skills/review/checks.md`:
   - **Automations:** S + R + P + M checks. If actions reference helpers, also H checks on those helpers.
   - **Scripts:** S + R + P + M + F checks. If actions reference helpers, also H checks.
   - **Helpers:**
     - storage-based family: H checks only
     - config-entry family: minimal config-entry review contract + collision scan on linked entities
   - Traverse all `variables:` blocks, not just the top-level block.
   - Storage-sensitive checks such as `R-18` may still be reported from the persisted read-back config even when the rest of the config matches the draft. Do not suppress them purely as pre-write dedup.
   - If persisted `R-18` remains after a write, add a manual next step to inspect traces after the next real run. Do not auto-trigger the config or auto-read traces from post-write review.
   - All other checks, including `R-19`, follow normal pre-write/post-write dedup. The explicit persisted-repeat exception stays unique to `R-18`.
   Focus on 🔴 findings. Report 🟠🟡 findings as advisory.
3. Collision scan: `search/related` for top target entities, max 3 related configs (standalone review uses max 5)
4. Output format (MUST appear in every post-write response) — localize headings per `skills/ha-nova/SKILL.md` → Output Localization:
   - **Findings**: 🔴🟠🟡 findings with short descriptive titles plus `Why` / `Fix`, or the localized equivalent of "No issues found in this review."
   - **Collision check**: conflicts, or the localized equivalent of "No related items found." when the scan found none, or "No conflicts found." when related items were checked without a collision risk.
   - **Advisory**: 🟠🟡 findings, or the localized equivalent of "No additional advisories."
   - Do not emit `Questions to consider`, `Suggestions`, or `Instant help` in post-write mode.

## Adding a New Skill — Checklist

When creating a new skill under `skills/{name}/SKILL.md`:

1. Skill file follows Skill Section Template (see above)
2. `skills/ha-nova/SKILL.md` — add to Dispatch table + add disambiguation examples
3. `skills/ha-nova/SKILL.md` — add domain to Response Format if needed
4. `skills/review/SKILL.md` — keep entrypoint/flow aligned; add or update detailed rules in `skills/review/checks.md`
5. `docs/reference/skill-architecture.md` — add to skill tree + add Architecture section
6. `docs/reference/skill-architecture.md` — add to Agent vs Inline table
7. `scripts/onboarding/install-local-skills.sh` — verify dynamic discovery picks up new skill
8. `README.md` / `PROJECT.md` — add skill to overview table/list
9. `version.json` — bump patch version
10. For file-based clients, re-run `npm run dev:install:<client>-skill` and start a new session. Use `npm run dev:sync` only when you need the Claude cache sync helper or already have a repo-local install to refresh.

## Review Check Single Source of Truth

`skills/review/SKILL.md` is the stable review entrypoint.
`skills/review/checks.md` is the authoritative source for the detailed review catalog (S/R/P/M/F/H).
Agent templates (`review-agent.md`) should enter through `skills/review/SKILL.md` and load `skills/review/checks.md` instead of duplicating checks.
When adding or modifying checks, update `skills/review/checks.md` first and keep `skills/review/SKILL.md` aligned as the facade/workflow file.

## Review Check Taxonomy

Review checks use the format `{CATEGORY}-{NN}`:
- `S` = Safety
- `R` = Reliability
- `P` = Performance
- `M` = Style
- `F` = Script-specific
- `H` = Helper-specific

`NN` is the running rule number inside that family. Severity is separate from the code.

Examples:
- `R-10` = the 10th reliability rule
- `H-09` = the 9th helper-specific rule

These codes are contributor-facing/internal only. User-facing output must use localized descriptive titles instead of exposing codes.

## Safety Baseline

Global safety expectations:
- no guessed ids
- preview before any write
- delete requires tokenized confirmation
- structured failure output: what failed / why / next step
- diagnostics only after real capability failure
- claim-evidence binding: verify data-target match before presenting conclusions (see context skill)

## Operational Goal

Minimize context and maintenance overhead while preserving strict write safety:
- flat skill layout for direct discovery
- context skill remains the stable top-level entrypoint
- centralized relay contract
- explicit phase boundaries
- deterministic preview/confirm/apply behavior
