# End-to-end verification against a REAL, disposable Home Assistant.
#
# Boots Home Assistant, completes its onboarding through the API, mints a
# long-lived access token, starts the standalone relay container against it,
# and asserts the guarantees that only a live system can prove:
#   - authentication is enforced (401 without a token)
#   - the relay reports its baked-in version, so the CLI's compatibility check works
#   - a health probe does NOT open the upstream WebSocket (no lazy-connect)...
#   - ...but /health honestly reports the connection once real traffic opened it
#   - REST and WS proxy calls return real Home Assistant data
#   - a bare subscription is rejected, but a bounded window is served
#
# Everything is destroyed afterwards. Run: bash scripts/e2e/disposable-ha/run.sh
