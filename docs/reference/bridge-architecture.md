# NOVA Relay: Architecture Reference

> **Implementation status:** Seven bounded local endpoint families are implemented.
> The Cloud remote Beta adds a Supervisor-ingress-only machine surface.
> Filesystem access is opt-in/off by default; streaming remains unimplemented.

## Overview

The Relay is a lean transport App on the HA host. It proxies WebSocket and REST,
offers contained opt-in file access, stores generic config snapshots, and
performs credential exchange. HA NOVA operates no public tunnel or broker;
optional remote traffic uses Home Assistant Cloud and Supervisor Ingress.

## Endpoints

### Implemented locally

```
GET  /health
GET  /home
POST /pair
POST /ws
POST /core
POST /files
POST /backups
```

### Phase 1c (+ Subscriptions) — PLANNED, NOT IMPLEMENTED

```
POST /ws/subscribe
```

---

## Endpoint Specifications — Implemented

### `GET /health`

Returns relay status. Wrapped in the standard envelope (`{ ok: true, data: ... }`).
Requires the relay bearer token like the other implemented endpoints.

```json
Response 200:
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {
    "status": "ok",
    "ha_ws_connected": true,
    "ha_ws_disconnect_reason": null,
    "version": "0.5.0",
    "uptime_s": 3600,
    "file_access": "off",
    "snapshots": { "files": 3, "bytes": 4096 }
  }
}
```

Connection status is observed state, not a probe. `GET /health` and `/core`
requests do not open the upstream Home Assistant WebSocket. A fresh Relay
therefore reports `ha_ws_connected: false` with
`ha_ws_disconnect_reason: "never_connected"` until the first real `/ws`
request; that pre-request state is not a connection failure. To prove
WebSocket readiness, issue `POST /ws` with `{"type":"ping"}` and then re-read
health. Require both a successful Relay envelope and
`ha_ws_connected: true`.

### `POST /pair` — Pairing Credential Exchange

This is the only route that does not accept the relay bearer token. Its
six-digit, ten-minute, single-use pairing code is the credential.

```json
Request:  { "code": "123456" }
Response: { "ok": true, "data": { "relay_token": "<opaque token>" } }
```

Malformed shapes return `400 VALIDATION_ERROR`. Wrong, expired, and replayed
codes share `401 PAIRING_FAILED`. Five failures per socket peer per minute or
30 globally per five minutes block further attempts with
`429 PAIRING_RATE_LIMITED` and `Retry-After`. The Relay ignores forwarded IP
headers, compares fixed digests in constant time, and sets
`Cache-Control: no-store` on every `/pair` response. Pairing contains no Home
Assistant call or domain logic.

### `GET /home` — Home Base

Home Base is a read-only HTML rendering of the same snapshot as `/health`, plus
the current pairing code, expiry, compatibility floor, and latest-stable
installer commands. It is bearer-exempt because Home Assistant Supervisor
ingress supplies the authenticated browser session instead.

The handler still requires the exact Supervisor ingress socket peer
(`172.30.32.2`, including IPv4-mapped IPv6 forms) plus `X-Ingress-Path` and
`X-Remote-User-Id`. Direct port access returns `403 INGRESS_REQUIRED` even when
the headers are spoofed. The response is non-cacheable, script-free, and ships
a restrictive CSP plus `nosniff`; the App sidebar panel is admin-only.

### `POST /ws` — Generic WS Proxy
```json
Request:
{
  "type": "config/area_registry/list"
}

Response 200:
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": [...]
}

Response 4xx/5xx:
{
  "ok": false,
  "error": { "code": "UPSTREAM_WS_ERROR", "message": "..." }
}
```

Validation: request body must contain a non-empty string field `type`.
On validation failure: `400 VALIDATION_ERROR`.
On upstream failure: `502 UPSTREAM_WS_ERROR` or `502 UPSTREAM_WS_TIMEOUT`.
For finite event-response WS commands, a Skill may opt in to bounded event
collection with an explicit envelope:

```json
{
  "message": { "type": "system_health/info" },
  "collect_events": {
    "until_type": "finish",
    "max_events": 100,
    "timeout_ms": 10000,
    "on_limit": "error"
  }
}
```

The Relay forwards `message`, collects events until `until_type`, and returns
them as `data.events`. It does not inspect command semantics or event payloads.

`on_limit` (relay 0.3.0) decides what happens when `max_events` or `timeout_ms`
is reached before the finish event:

- `"error"` (default): fail with `502 UPSTREAM_WS_ERROR` / `UPSTREAM_WS_TIMEOUT` — the original strict semantics.
- `"return"` (window mode): resolve with the events collected so far and set `data.truncated: true`. This is what makes bounded *sniffing* possible for streams that never emit a finish event (MQTT topics, event buses).

**Subscription commands are allowed INSIDE a `collect_events` envelope** (relay
0.3.0). The two reasons for the general ban do not apply there: the collection
unsubscribes in its `finally` block, and its lifetime is bounded by
`max_events`/`timeout_ms`, so no upstream subscription can leak or accumulate.
A *bare* subscription (no envelope) is still rejected with
`400 UNSUPPORTED_WS_TYPE`, because the relay could neither deliver its events
nor bound its lifetime.

Batch mode (array request bodies) is NOT supported: the WS proxy validates a
single object with a string `type` and rejects arrays with
`400 VALIDATION_ERROR` (`nova/src/http/handlers/ws-proxy.ts`). Callers loop
client-side, one command per request.

### `POST /core` — REST Core Proxy

Proxies arbitrary HA REST API calls through the Relay. Used by write, helper,
and review skills to call HA REST endpoints without needing the upstream token.

```json
Request:
{
  "method": "GET",        // "GET" | "POST" | "DELETE"
  "path": "/api/states",  // must start with /api/
  "body": { ... }         // optional, used with POST
}

Response 200:
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {
    "status": 200,
    "body": [ ... ]
  }
}

Response 400 (validation):
{
  "ok": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Request body must contain: method ('GET'|'POST'|'DELETE') and path ('/api/...')"
  }
}

Response 502 (upstream failure):
{
  "ok": false,
  "error": { "code": "UPSTREAM_HTTP_ERROR", "message": "..." }
}
```

Security:
- `path` must start with `/api/`; absolute URLs are rejected.
- Path traversal (`..`, `\`, encoded variants) is blocked via iterative decode + check.
- Path length capped at 2048 characters.
- Control characters in path are rejected.
- Upstream request timeout: 10 s (default).

## Additional Endpoint Specifications

Only the streaming endpoint below remains planned. `/files` and `/backups` are
implemented and covered by their handler tests.

### `POST /ws/subscribe` — Event Subscription
```json
Request:
{
  "type": "subscribe_events",
  "event_type": "state_changed",
  "duration_sec": 30
}

Response: SSE-Stream
data: {"event_type":"state_changed","data":{...}}
data: {"event_type":"state_changed","data":{...}}
```

Limits: max 300s duration, max 5 concurrent subscriptions.

### `POST /files` — Filesystem Operations (implemented)
```json
// list_dir
{ "action": "list_dir", "path": "/config/ha_nova", "limit": 200 }

// read_file
{ "action": "read_file", "path": "/config/ha_nova/templates/my_sensor.yaml", "max_bytes": 200000 }

// write_file
{ "action": "write_file", "path": "/config/ha_nova/templates/my_sensor.yaml", "content": "..." }

// delete_file
{ "action": "delete_file", "path": "/config/ha_nova/sensors/rest/old.yaml" }
```

Security:
- Paths must be within `/config` (HA config root)
- Deny-list segments: `.storage`, `.cloud`, `.ssh`, `.git`, `deps`, `ssl`, `tts`, `backups`, `custom_components`, `python_scripts`, `www` — plus secret/db/env/log filename patterns
- Symlink traversal check
- Writes gated by extension (`.yaml`, `.yml`, `.conf`, `.json`, `.txt`, `.md`); there is no directory whitelist — keeping HA NOVA files under `/config/ha_nova/` is skill convention, not relay enforcement

### `POST /backups` — Config-snapshot store (implemented)

Relay-side storage for CONFIG snapshots (automation JSON, etc.) — distinct from
HA system backups, which `ha-nova:backup` manages via `/ws` `backup/*` today.

```json
// list
{ "action": "list", "category": "automations" }

// save
{ "action": "save", "category": "automations", "name": "before-cleanup", "data": "..." }

// load
{ "action": "load", "file": "automations/before-cleanup-2026-02-25.json.gz" }

// prune
{ "action": "prune", "max_age_days": 30, "max_files": 100 }

// delete
{ "action": "delete", "file": "automations/old-backup.json.gz" }
```

## Auth — Separate Inbound and Upstream Credentials

The Relay keeps inbound client authentication separate from upstream Home Assistant authentication:

| Distribution/path | Credential | Purpose |
|--------------|------------|---------|
| Legacy/standalone inbound | `RELAY_AUTH_TOKEN` | Authenticates direct client requests to the Relay |
| App paired-device inbound | Per-device credential | Authenticates direct TLS requests on the pinned device listener |
| App Cloud Ingress inbound | User- and Relay-bound per-device credential | Authenticates functional requests after the Supervisor Ingress identity gate |
| Home Assistant App upstream | `SUPERVISOR_TOKEN` | Authenticates upstream REST and WebSocket requests through the Supervisor Core proxies |
| Standalone Container/Core upstream | `HA_LLAT` | Authenticates upstream requests directly with Home Assistant |

**Legacy/standalone inbound (client -> Relay):**
```
Authorization: Bearer {RELAY_AUTH_TOKEN}
```
Validated via a constant-time fixed-digest comparison. On failure:
`401 UNAUTHORIZED`. Exact `POST /pair` uses the one-time pairing code instead
and returns the same relay token after a successful exchange.

The normal App path uses an OPAQUE-derived per-device credential over SPKI-pinned
TLS. Cloud sends it through a process-local Supervisor Ingress session. Pairing
v2 atomically activates a user-bound device; existing devices bind only when the
Relay instance matches. Legacy shared tokens are rejected on Ingress routes.

**Upstream (Relay -> HA):**
The Home Assistant App prefers its process-local `SUPERVISOR_TOKEN` and sends it
only to the official `http://supervisor/core/api` and
`ws://supervisor/core/websocket` proxies. Standalone Container/Core uses
`HA_LLAT` against its configured Home Assistant URL. When both variables exist,
Supervisor auth wins so an obsolete legacy App LLAT cannot break the App.

Inbound and upstream credentials are independent. New App installs create and
persist a random 32-byte relay token under `/data` with owner-only permissions.
Existing App relay-token option values remain authoritative. The App
configuration still ships an `ha_llat` field, but only as a one-time
legacy-migration source: a normal App install leaves it empty and authenticates
upstream with its Supervisor token. Standalone Container/Core installs must
provide both `RELAY_AUTH_TOKEN` and `HA_LLAT` server-side.

The interactive CLI's normal App path never asks the user to copy the relay
token. It asks for the current Home Base code, sends it only in the JSON body of
`POST /pair`, stores the returned token in the existing OS credential backend,
and verifies both `/health` and `/ws`. Pairing requests do not follow redirects;
the code is not accepted through argv and is not persisted in normal config.
Saved credentials, `--relay-token`, service token files, and standalone
Container/Core setups retain their explicit-token paths.

The Cloud Beta contract is
`docs/work/2026-07-25-home-assistant-cloud-remote-spec.md`.

## WS Forwarding Policy

The Relay forwards authenticated WS messages as passthrough requests.
Message-type filtering is not applied locally.

## Configuration

All configuration is via environment variables. The `run` entrypoint script
resolves values from HA app options and sets them before starting Node.

```yaml
# App: set RELAY_AUTH_TOKEN_FILE; RELAY_AUTH_TOKEN remains a legacy override.
# Standalone: RELAY_AUTH_TOKEN is required.
RELAY_AUTH_TOKEN: "<operator-chosen-secret>"   # Inbound client auth override
RELAY_AUTH_TOKEN_FILE: "/data/relay_auth_token" # App-owned persistent token
SUPERVISOR_TOKEN: "<injected-by-supervisor>"   # App upstream auth; never configured by the user
HA_LLAT: "<ha-long-lived-access-token>"        # Standalone upstream auth fallback
MIN_RELAY_VERSION: "<from nova/version.json>" # Required Relay floor shown in Home Base

# Optional (with defaults)
HA_URL: "http://supervisor/core"               # App default; standalone default: http://homeassistant:8123
RELAY_PORT: 8791                               # Default: 8791
LOG_LEVEL: "info"                              # trace|debug|info|warn|error, default: info
RELAY_VERSION: "dev"                           # Injected by run script from bashio
APP_OPTIONS_PATH: "/data/options.json"         # HA app options file path
```

`MIN_RELAY_VERSION` is loaded from `nova/version.json`, a generated mirror of
the root `version.json` SSOT. The bump script and its contract keep the mirror
in sync; Relay and product versions must not be substituted for each other.

## Tech Stack

- TypeScript / Node.js >=20
- No HTTP framework (Node.js `http.createServer`)
- REST client uses native `fetch()` (no axios at runtime)
- WS orchestration uses `home-assistant-js-websocket`
- `ws` supplies the authenticated Node WebSocket transport; REST stays on native `fetch()`
- Current scope is contract-capped at 3,900 TypeScript source lines

## Standard Envelope

All responses follow the same JSON envelope (defined in `types/api.ts`):

```typescript
// Success
{ ok: true, data: T }

// Error
{ ok: false, error: { code: string, message: string } }
```

HTTP status is 200 for success. Error status codes include 400 (validation),
401 (auth), 404 (route not found), 413 (body cap), 429 (pairing rate limit),
502 (upstream failure), and 500 (internal).

## What the Relay does NOT do

- No business logic
- No validation rules (beyond request format and path safety)
- No Home Assistant domain-state caching
- No consent gating
- No session management
- No metrics (structured JSON logging only)
- No MCP protocol
