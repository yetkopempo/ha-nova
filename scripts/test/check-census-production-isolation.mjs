// Static gate (#446): no test, smoke, release, or deployment-verification
// path may call the PRODUCTION census Worker's mutation endpoints. Production
// statistics represent voluntary real participants only; functional census
// checks run exclusively against the isolated test Worker
// (wrangler env "test", scripts/release/verify-census-functional.sh).
//
// The scan is deliberately simple: inside the executable surfaces (scripts/,
// tests/, .github/), a file fails when it (a) combines the production census
// host and a mutation path on ONE line, or (b) assigns the production host to
// a URL variable and later builds a mutation URL from that variable. Local
// wrangler-dev smokes (local_url) and prose stay clean; the read-only
// deployment check may reference the production host, but never build a
// mutation URL from it. cli/ (the product itself) is out of scope.
