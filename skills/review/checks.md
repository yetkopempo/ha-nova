# HA NOVA Review Check Catalog

Canonical path: `skills/review/checks.md`

Self-contained catalog: load this file before evaluating findings — from `skills/review/SKILL.md` for standalone reviews, or directly from `skills/write/SKILL.md` / `skills/helper/SKILL.md` post-write phases.

## Output Guardrail (Critical)

- Apply `skills/ha-nova/output-rules.md` whenever this catalog informs user-facing output.
- Check codes (`R-17`, `S-01`, `H-02`, ...) are internal reasoning artifacts, not user-facing labels.
- Instead, describe each finding in plain language: a short descriptive title plus why it matters and how to fix it.
- This guardrail applies whenever check knowledge is used, not only during formal review runs.

## Verify Before Flagging (Critical)

A finding that turns out to be valid Home Assistant costs the user more trust
than a missed one costs them behavior. Before reporting ANY issue, resolve it
against a source rather than memory, in this order:

1. `skills/ha-nova/template-guidelines.md` for template and Jinja questions,
   `skills/ha-nova/best-practices.md` and
   `skills/ha-nova/automation-patterns.md` for trigger/action/mode shapes,
   `skills/ha-nova/helper-schemas.md` and
   `skills/ha-nova/helper-flow-schemas.md` for helper fields.
2. If the local reference does not settle it, the official documentation page
   for that surface: triggers <https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/trigger/>,
   modes <https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/modes/>, scripts
   <https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/scripts/>, templating
   <https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/templating/>, YAML schema
   <https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/yaml/>.
3. Flag it when the settling source confirms the CLAIM you are making. Most
   of this catalog is not about schema validity: R-02, R-06, P-04 and M-05
   describe configurations Home Assistant accepts happily and that still
   misbehave, deprecate, or fire at the wrong moment. For those the source
   must confirm the semantics or the risk — "valid YAML" never clears them.
   Only schema-shaped checks need the source to call the config invalid.
4. Scene, dashboard and cross-item families split their evidence in two, and
   conflating the halves is how an unsupported finding gets shipped:
   - EXISTENCE and JOIN facts — this card references a resource that is not
     in `lovelace/resources`, this scene captures two colour attributes, this
     entity_id appears in three automations — come from the live data the run
     already read. Nothing else can prove them.
   - The BEHAVIOURAL claim attached to them comes from a named source, and
     each claim has exactly one: that mixed colour attributes reproduce wrong
     or a domain is not reproducible — `skills/scene/SKILL.md` → Capture
     attributes deliberately; that a built-in card field is required — the
     D-07 allowlist above, which is the only schema pin in this repo and is
     deliberately closed (a type not on it has no known required field, so it
     produces no finding); that a save loses omitted content or a custom-card
     schema cannot be invented — `skills/dashboard/SKILL.md` → Critical
     behavior. Beyond those, the Lovelace and scene pages on
     home-assistant.io. Citing a section that does not carry the claim is the
     same error as citing nothing.
   State the observation from the data and the consequence from the source.
   If only the observation holds, report the observation.
5. Unresolved means unresolved: report it as a question, never as an error.

This applies wherever findings are generated — the standalone review flow and
the post-write phases in write, helper, and yaml-config alike, which load this
file directly and never see the review skill's copy of the rule.

## Check Taxonomy (internal only)

- Format: `{CATEGORY}-{NN}` (example: `H-09`)
- Category letter = family: `S` safety, `R` reliability, `P` performance, `M` style, `F` script-specific, `H` helper-specific, `SC` scene, `D` dashboard, `HX` cross-item, `TS` template/REST/command-line sensors (YAML)
- Number = running rule number within that family
- Severity is separate from the code
- Code visibility is governed by the Output Guardrail above

## Application (family matrix + evidence boundaries)

Orphan/no-consumer verdicts (F-09, H-07, SC-07, collision scans) fail closed: read `search/related` through `skills/ha-nova/search-related-consumers.jq` (recreate per `skills/ha-nova/relay-api.md` → Parsing rule on flat-copy installs; its automation/script/scene projection covers F-09's scene requirement); a failed or unexecuted scan is inconclusive — never evidence of an orphan.

**Apply these families by domain:**
- Automation: S-01..S-03, R-01..R-31, P-01..P-05, M-01..M-05
- Script: automation families plus F-01..F-09
- Storage scene: SC-01..SC-07
- Storage dashboard: D-01..D-07
- Cross-item: HX-01..HX-05 — only during aggregate/bulk reviews or when the registry context is already loaded; never a license for a full-instance sweep the user did not ask for
- Template/REST/command-line sensor YAML: TS-01..TS-07 — applied by `ha-nova:yaml-config` at write time, and by review only when such YAML is in the workset
- Helper (storage-based family): H-01..H-11
- Helper (config-entry family): minimal config-entry review plus H-12/H-13/H-15 where the fields are readable — reading `source`/member/template fields requires the non-persisting options-flow readback (the `skills/helper/SKILL.md` pattern) or the rendered-state read; when that readback is unavailable, say the fields were not readable instead of skipping silently — and H-14 when the energy prefs are already loaded
  - do not apply H-01..H-11
  - confirm config-entry metadata is present
  - inspect linked entities when available
  - in Step 2, derive collision candidates from `linked_entities[]`, not from config actions
  - run `search/related` on up to 3 linked entities
  - say explicitly that config-entry helper review does not use the storage-helper H rules
  - for the `template` domain, also read the linked entity's rendered state (`unavailable`/`unknown` is inconclusive, not proof of breakage — source state or an intentional sentinel); to apply the template-level reliability checks, open the options flow for the entry first (non-persisting readback — the canonical metadata item does not carry the `state` template)
- If an automation or script references helpers in actions or direct thresholds, also apply H-01..H-11 to those helpers (H-11 is exactly the case where the consumer is in the workset)
- R-17 is an intra-config branch comparison only. Never emit it from collision scan or cross-automation conflict analysis.
- R-18 applies only to sibling-variable references within one `variables:` mapping. Never emit it for cross-action or cross-scope references, script `fields`, HA builtins, or `{% set %}` locals inside the same template.
- For R-18 output, include the block context plus at least one concrete variable pair. For pasted YAML or draft configs, describe it as future write fragility. For HA read-back or post-write review, describe it as a persisted runtime risk.
- R-19 applies only to Jinja2 chains with `if` plus at least one `elif`, entity-state-style branch guards, and a terminal bare `else` that contains a direct `trigger.id` comparison. Skip single `if` / `else`, `trigger.id` in `elif`, non-entity-state selector trees, `else` blocks with extra explicit guards, and `choose` + `condition: trigger`.
- For R-19 output, state: final else branch is only reached when the earlier entity-state branches are false. Move the `trigger.id` check into an explicit `elif`. Or refactor to `choose` + `condition: trigger`.
- R-23 applies only to boolean-like templates compared to string boolean literals (`'True'`, `'true'`, `'False'`, `'false'`) in either comparison direction. Do not flag bare boolean checks such as `is true` or `== true`.
- R-24 is advisory only and applies only when a capacity-like variable reads an `available_energy` source. Do not hard-code integration-specific replacement entities.
- R-25 applies only to pasted or draft YAML containing `platform: template` entity definitions (domain-level blocks or bare `!include`-file lists); configs read back from HA never carry this syntax. When it fires, fetch the HA version via `/api/config` on demand and phrase the finding version-sensitively (removed as of HA 2026.6; deprecated 2025.12–2026.5; still current earlier — see the R-25 Evidence Boundary in `skills/review/checks.md`).
- R-31 applies only to contradictory fixed `condition: state` checks on the same `entity_id` inside one implicit or explicit AND scope. Skip OR scopes and checks separated across distinct branches.
- M-05 is a modernize advisory for legacy automation keys (`platform:` in triggers, singular `trigger:`/`condition:`/`action:` blocks). Mention once, never as an error, never rewrite just to modernize.

**Live helper evidence for H-09/H-10:**
- See `skills/review/checks.md` → Helper Threshold Evidence
- Read `/api/states/<helper_entity_id>` only when the threshold reference is direct
- If `state`, `attributes.min`, `attributes.max`, or `attributes.step` are missing or non-numeric, skip H-09/H-10
- Do not emit unrelated findings just because an H-09/H-10 signal matched

## Safety (Critical)

- S-01: Hardcoded secrets (tokens, passwords, API keys, long webhook IDs as literals)
- S-02: `entity_id: all` or domain-wide targets without explicit intent
- S-03: Webhook trigger with `local_only: false` (exposes webhook to internet)

## Reliability (High)

- R-01 [HIGH]: `float`/`int` template filter without `default` argument
- R-02 [MEDIUM → HIGH]: `trigger: state` trigger without `to:` (fires on every attribute change). Default MEDIUM. Escalate to HIGH with concrete pile-up evidence (see R-02 Evidence Boundary).
- R-03 [MEDIUM]: Physical sensor trigger on inactive/cleared state (no-motion, door closed) without `for:` debounce — immediate-response triggers (motion detected → on) are fine without `for:`
- R-04 [MEDIUM → HIGH]: `wait_for_trigger` or `wait_template` without `timeout:`. Default to MEDIUM as a defensive safety-net recommendation. Escalate to HIGH only with concrete unrecoverable-hang evidence (see R-04 Evidence Boundary).
- R-05 [MEDIUM]: `mode` not explicitly set (defaults to `single` — re-invocations dropped with warning)
- R-06 [HIGH]: `mode: single` combined with `delay:` or `wait_*` (trigger drops during wait, logged as warning)
- R-07 [HIGH]: `mode: restart` with asymmetric on/off action pairs (partial execution risk)
- R-08 [HIGH]: `mode: parallel` referencing shared mutable state (`input_number`, `counter`, `input_boolean`)
- R-09 [MEDIUM]: `choose:` without `default:` branch (silently does nothing when no condition matches)
- R-10 [HIGH]: `mode: queued` with `delay:` or `wait_*` blocks and `max:` ≤ 3 combined with ≥ 3 triggers — queue saturation risk (triggers dropped with WARNING log when queue full during delays; truly silent only if `max_exceeded: silent` is set); severity intensifies if any trigger also matches R-02 at HIGH (unfiltered `trigger: state` without `to:` plus pile-up-prone mode multiplies trigger frequency)
- R-11 [HIGH]: `float(0)` or `int(0)` default on sensor values used in physical calculations (temperature, humidity, pressure) — 0 is physically wrong and produces silently incorrect results; use `float(none)` with an availability guard (`has_value()`) or a realistic fallback value
- R-12 [MEDIUM → HIGH]: Self-trigger / feedback loop — automation triggers on an entity (e.g., `input_select`, `input_boolean`, `input_number`) that it also sets in its own actions; HA has NO built-in self-trigger protection. Default MEDIUM. Escalate to HIGH with `mode: queued`, `mode: parallel`, or `mode: restart` (queued/parallel pile up runs until `max:` is hit; restart re-enters mid-execution so the action chain never completes). Fix: remove the trigger, add a `condition` guard comparing new vs. previous value, or use `mode: single` as partial protection. See R-12 Evidence Boundary.
- R-13 [MEDIUM]: Trigger without `id:` in `choose:`-based automations — makes `trigger.id` matching impossible; branches using `condition: trigger` require trigger IDs to function
- R-14 [MEDIUM]: Dead trigger — trigger has `id:` but that ID is never referenced in any `condition: trigger`, `choose:`, or template expression; likely copy-paste remnant or unfinished logic
- R-15 [MEDIUM]: Asymmetric error handling — same physical action (e.g., `cover.open_cover`, `climate.set_temperature`) appears in multiple branches but only some have retry/fallback logic; inconsistent reliability across code paths
- R-16 [HIGH]: Templated event name — `event_type:` does not evaluate templates in event triggers; the automation attaches to the literal string and silently misses the intended event. Use a fixed `event_type` and move dynamic logic into conditions or event data handling.
- R-17 [MEDIUM → HIGH]: Intra-config overwrite/rebound risk — the same entity/helper is written in 2+ distinct control-flow branches and the write basis is mixed. Typical risk shape: one branch advances live state incrementally, another branch later recomputes or resets from snapshot/start value/timer/fallback/baseline. Default to MEDIUM. Escalate to HIGH only when a later branch can plausibly overwrite/reset value already advanced by an earlier branch.
- R-18 [HIGH]: Same-block sibling variable dependency — within one `variables:` mapping, variable A references sibling variable B from that same `variables:` mapping. HA storage/API writes may reorder mapping keys, so the saved variable order can evaluate A before B. Apply to top-level and local `variables:` blocks only when at least one concrete fragile pair exists. Report the block context plus at least one concrete pair (for example `check_flag -> reading`). For draft or pasted YAML, frame this as future write fragility. For HA read-back or post-write review, frame it as a persisted runtime risk.
- R-19 [MEDIUM]: Unreachable `trigger.id` in bare `else` branch — a Jinja2 `if` + `elif` chain uses entity-state-style guards, and the terminal bare `else` contains a direct `trigger.id` comparison. final else branch is only reached when the earlier entity-state branches are false. Move the `trigger.id` check into an explicit `elif`. Or refactor to `choose` + `condition: trigger`.
- R-20 [MEDIUM]: `trigger_variables` using `states()`, `is_state()`, `state_attr()`, or other state-snapshot helpers — evaluated once at attach time; the captured value is stale for the lifetime of the automation and silently produces wrong values (not stylistic — real reliability hazard). Fix: use a top-level `variables:` block evaluated per run, or read state inside the action template instead. (Migrated from former M-04.)
- R-21 [HIGH]: Reverse branch without re-entry guard on capture-state flag — a complementary forward/reverse branch pair (save/restore, activate/deactivate, arm/disarm) where the forward branch saves state and sets a flag (any helper type, for example an `input_boolean`), but the reverse branch fires on its trigger alone without a condition that the flag is set. The reverse branch then also runs after cycles where the forward branch never executed and silently overwrites user-set state with stale helper values — no error, no log. Fix: guard the reverse branch on the flag being set, and clear the flag after restoring. Applies to `choose:` branches, `if/else` actions, and trigger-id-split action chains; bidirectional. See R-21 Evidence Boundary.
- R-22 [HIGH]: Restart-dependent restore from transient storage — a restore path is reachable from a Home Assistant startup trigger (`trigger: homeassistant` with `event: start`), but the state it restores was captured in a transient construct (`scene.create` runtime snapshot, automation/script `variables:`, `trigger_variables`, timer without `restore: true`). Transient constructs do not survive a restart, so the startup restore path silently does nothing or applies wrong values. Fix: persist the saved state in a helper (`input_number`, `input_text`, `input_select`, ...) or another persistent construct — see `skills/ha-nova/best-practices.md` → Persistence Model. See R-22 Evidence Boundary.
- R-23 [MEDIUM]: Boolean-like template compared to a string literal — a template compares a boolean-like variable or expression to `'True'`, `"True"`, `'true'`, `"true"`, `'False'`, `"False"`, `'false'`, or `"false"`, including reversed comparisons such as `'True' == avg_valid`. Home Assistant traces can expose template variables as real booleans, so string comparison can make a valid plan evaluate false. Fix: use the boolean directly (`{{ avg_valid }}`), negate it directly (`{{ not avg_valid }}`), or use boolean tests when genuinely needed. Do not flag bare boolean comparisons such as `== true`, `is true`, or `is sameas true`.
- R-24 [LOW]: Capacity-like variable reads `available_energy` — a variable named like `capacity`, `capacity_kwh`, `maximum_energy`, or similar reads an entity containing `available_energy`. Available charge may not be nominal or maximum battery capacity, so calculated targets can be wrong. Advisory only: verify whether a maximum, nominal, or capacity entity is the intended source. Do not hard-code integration-specific replacements or automatically rewrite entity IDs.
- R-25 [HIGH]: Legacy template platform syntax (removed in HA 2026.6) — pasted/draft YAML defines template entities under a domain platform key (`sensor:`, `binary_sensor:`, `cover:`, `fan:`, `light:`, `lock:`, `switch:`, `vacuum:`, `weather:`, or `alarm_control_panel:` containing `- platform: template`), or as a bare top-level `- platform: template` list (pasted contents of an `!include` file such as `sensors.yaml`; entity-shaped items only, see the Evidence Boundary). Home Assistant 2026.6 removed this syntax entirely: the entities silently stop being created — no error banner, automations depending on them stop firing. It was deprecated in 2025.12 and still current before that — always phrase per the version split in the R-25 Evidence Boundary. Fix: migrate to the modern top-level `template:` syntax (`value_template` → `state`, `friendly_name` → `name`, per-entity maps → list items). Applies only when reviewing pasted or draft YAML (see R-25 Evidence Boundary).

- R-26 [MEDIUM → HIGH]: Exact-state equality narrower than the stated intent — a condition/trigger pins one literal state (classic: `== 'not_home'`) on a domain whose runtime states exceed a simple pair (person/device_tracker report named zones as states; media_player, vacuum, climate carry multi-state enums), while the user's stated intent is the broader category ("nobody home", "the TV is off" — which `standby`/`idle` also satisfy). The config is valid, saves, reloads, and read-back matches — it just never matches legitimate runtime states (a person at zone `work` has state `work`, not `not_home`). Fix: express the category (`!= 'home'` for away-semantics, `zone.home` person count for nobody-home, negations over enumerations). Default MEDIUM; escalate to HIGH when the narrow comparison gates the automation's core purpose. See R-26 Evidence Boundary.
- R-27 [MEDIUM]: Fixed `delay:` standing in for asynchronous completion — an action starts an asynchronous operation (non-blocking `script.turn_on`, a device command that takes variable time) and a following fixed `delay:` is the only thing "guaranteeing" completion before dependent actions run. The delay documents a hope, not a fact. Fix: `wait_template`/`wait_for_trigger` on the actual completion signal, with `timeout:` (R-04) and a defined timeout path. Do not flag delays that are themselves the intent (light on for 5 minutes).
- R-28 [MEDIUM]: Startup race — a `trigger: homeassistant` / `event: start` path immediately reads integration-backed entity states in conditions or actions. Right after startup those states can be `unknown`, `unavailable`, or stale-restored before their integration first updates. Fix: guard with an availability wait (`wait_template` on `has_value(...)` with timeout) or accept-and-document the race. Helpers restore their own state and rarely need the guard; template sensors inherit the race from their integration-backed dependencies.
- R-29 [HIGH]: Edge-triggered "watchdog" without a persistent-fault path — the name, description, or user request promises watchdog/self-healing/continuous-monitoring continuity (a recovery-shaped action alone is never that evidence — an intentionally one-shot recovery is its own class), but every entry is a one-time firing — an unhealthy-state edge trigger (`numeric_state`, `state` to an unhealthy value, binary health sensor, template false→true), with or without a `homeassistant` startup trigger beside it (startup fires once per boot and keeps nothing live) — and no bounded retry, periodic re-evaluation, or failure escalation exists. A failed recovery with a continuously unhealthy signal never re-fires, and an HA restart into an existing fault sees no transition. Also flag a missing post-action health re-check (`skills/ha-nova/outcome-verification.md`), and evaluate multi-target recovery liveness per target. Contract: `skills/ha-nova/recovery-workflows.md`. See R-29 Evidence Boundary.
- R-30 [MEDIUM → HIGH]: Retry-policy violation in a recovery workflow — an unbounded or implicit attempt count (`repeat`/`until` without a finite bound, self-re-triggering loop), a retry keyed on a bare service-call error or an ambiguous transport failure instead of semantic failure evidence, a retried physical-access/irreversible/non-idempotent action, missing outcome verification between attempts (a SINGLE-attempt recovery without its post-action health probe is the same defect — one-shot never exempts the probe), no `mode`/guard against overlapping recovery runs, periodic re-entry without a cooldown where one is necessary (an interval that already exceeds the bounded execution time with a non-overlapping `mode` needs none), no explicit delay or backoff between attempts (an immediate re-attempt hammers the failing device — the owning policy requires a per-case choice), retry state shared across targets, exhaustion emitting more than one notification per incident (notification storm), or NO explicit exhaustion path at all — a finite loop that simply ends after the last failed probe silently abandons the unhealthy target (an explicitly ONE-SHOT recovery with its single action and post-action probe is exempt: reporting the probe's honest outcome IS its end state, no retry or escalation was requested). Policy: `skills/ha-nova/recovery-workflows.md`. Default MEDIUM; escalate to HIGH for unbounded loops, unsafe repeat actions, or ambiguous-failure retries. See R-30 Evidence Boundary.
- R-31 [HIGH]: Contradictory fixed state conditions in one conjunction — the same `entity_id` is required to have mutually exclusive literal states inside one implicit or explicit AND scope, making the branch unreachable. Example: one branch requires the same binary sensor to be both `on` and `off`. Fix: put intentional alternatives under one `condition: or` block, or remove the contradictory requirement. See R-31 Evidence Boundary.

## R-02 Evidence Boundary

Without `to:`, a `trigger: state` fires on every attribute change of the entity. The footgun is real but its blast radius depends entirely on the automation's mode:

- Default severity: **MEDIUM**. Frame as "you probably did not mean for this to fire on every attribute change". Suggested wording: *"Add `to:` so the trigger only fires when the state actually changes — without it, every attribute update (signal strength, last seen, etc.) re-runs the automation."*
- Escalate to **HIGH** only with concrete pile-up evidence:
  - `mode: queued` — every attribute change consumes a queue slot; high-frequency entities (motion sensors, signal-strength reporters, climate devices) can saturate the queue.
  - `mode: parallel` — every attribute change spawns a parallel run; combined with shared mutable state this is the same hazard as R-08.
  - Action chain has non-idempotent side effects (counter increments, notifications, service calls that change physical state) — every spurious fire is a real-world side effect.
- Do not escalate purely on `mode: single` or `mode: restart`. With `single`, surplus fires drop with a warning (log noise, not breakage). With `restart`, the action is bounded.
- Skip when an explicit `not_to:`/`not_from:` filter is present and adequately scopes the trigger.

## R-04 Evidence Boundary

The pattern (a `wait_*` action without `timeout:`) is a defensive lint, not always an active bug. Severity must reflect whether the worst-case hang is recoverable.

- Default severity: **MEDIUM**. The wait pattern is suboptimal but most setups recover via re-trigger or natural state changes. Frame as a safety-net recommendation, not an alarm. Suggested wording shape: *"Add `timeout:` as a safety net — `mode: restart` already protects most cases, but a stuck sensor would still hang the chain."*
- Escalate to **HIGH** only with at least one concrete unrecoverable-hang signal:
  - `mode: single` — re-triggers are dropped while the wait is active, so a stuck condition has no recovery path. (This may also match R-06; keep R-04 distinct only when the wait itself is the diagnostic anchor.)
  - The wait sits inside a `repeat:` loop with no other timeout/break — every iteration can hang independently and queue up.
  - The awaited entity has a known-flaky platform signature (battery-powered Zigbee/BLE sensors with no `availability:`, deprecated integrations, MQTT topics with no LWT) — a stuck `on` state is the realistic failure mode, not a hypothetical one.
  - The action chain following the wait is on a critical path (e.g., off-actions, alarm disarm, security gating) where a permanent hang is materially harmful.
- Do not escalate to HIGH purely because of `mode: restart`. Restart is a real mitigation: any new trigger event resets the wait. The only restart case worth HIGH is when the trigger is so rare that "next event" is unrealistic (e.g., daily-only triggers).
- Suggested fix tone:
  - MEDIUM: *"Add `timeout:` (e.g., `'00:10:00'`) with `continue_on_timeout: true` as a defensive guard."*
  - HIGH: *"Add `timeout:` immediately — without it the action chain has no exit and `mode: single` provides no recovery."*

## R-12 Evidence Boundary

Self-trigger / feedback loop = the automation triggers on an entity that it also writes in its own actions. HA has no built-in self-trigger protection; whether this becomes an infinite loop depends on `mode:`.

- Default severity: **MEDIUM**. With `mode: single`, the second self-write while a run is active is dropped (HA logs a warning). The loop is bounded but every run produces warning-spam and the intended logic likely still misfires once. Suggested wording: *"This automation triggers on an entity it also writes — with `mode: single` the loop is bounded but every run logs a self-trigger warning. Add a `condition:` guard comparing new vs. previous value, or remove the self-targeting trigger."*
- Escalate to **HIGH** with concrete unbounded-loop evidence:
  - `mode: queued` — every self-write enqueues another run until `max:` is hit. With default `max: 10` this is ten queued runs per write, plus dropped events afterward.
  - `mode: parallel` — every self-write spawns a parallel run; combined with shared state this is catastrophic.
  - `mode: restart` — every self-write restarts the current run mid-execution; the loop never terminates, the action chain never completes.
- Skip when a `condition:` guard provably breaks the cycle (e.g., compare `trigger.to_state.state != trigger.from_state.state`, or check an idempotent set with `is_state(...)` before writing).
- Skip when the trigger and action target the same entity but with structurally different values (e.g., trigger on `state == on`, action sets `state == off`).
- This rule must verify trigger/action overlap independently. Do not infer from H-09 co-match alone.

## R-17 Evidence Boundary

- Apply only within one automation or one script. Never use collision-scan results to trigger R-17.
- First confirm same target entity/helper is written in 2+ distinct control-flow paths such as `choose`, `default`, `if`/`then`/`else`, timeout, recovery, or fallback branches.
- Then compare write-basis classes:
  - `live/incremental`: increment/decrement, add/subtract from current state, or otherwise advance existing value
  - `recompute/reset`: set from snapshot, start value, timer duration, fallback constant, or baseline rebuild
- Skip when all writes use the same basis class, when the writes are idempotent duplicates, or when fixed preset branches are the intended behavior.
- Do not use R-17 for generic repeated writes, cross-automation conflicts, or existing `mode: parallel` race cases already covered by R-08 / F-05.

## R-18 Evidence Boundary

- Apply only within one `variables:` mapping. Never derive R-18 from references that cross action boundaries, sequence steps, or outer scopes.
- Traverse all `variables:` mappings in the config, not just the top-level block:
  - root `variables:` on the automation or script
  - local `variables:` actions inside `choose`, `if` / `then` / `else`, `default`, `repeat`, and nested `sequence` blocks
- First confirm the referenced name is a sibling variable declared in that same mapping.
- Skip HA builtins and runtime vars such as `trigger`, `this`, `wait`, `repeat`, `states()`, `is_state()`, and similar documented helpers.
- Skip `{% set %}` locals inside one template. Those are internal to the template and do not depend on sibling key order in the outer `variables:` mapping.
- Skip script `fields` references and values inherited from previous `variables` actions or outer scopes.
- Skip self-references such as `count: "{{ count + 1 }}"`; those depend on outer scope or previous run context, not a sibling key.
- Use conservative matching. Do not infer a dependency from broad substring overlap or from names that only appear inside string literals/comments.
- Preferred fixes:
  - use a self-contained template with internal `{% set %}` statements
  - split the dependency across ordered `variables` actions when later actions need the derived value

## R-23 Evidence Boundary

- Apply only inside template expressions, not ordinary text, aliases, comments, or example prose.
- Match equality and inequality comparisons in either direction:
  - boolean-like expression compared to string literal
  - string literal compared to boolean-like expression
- Treat these as boolean-like:
  - variable names ending in `_valid`, `_enabled`, `_fresh`, `_ready`, `_ok`, `_active`
  - variable names starting with `is_`, `has_`, `should_`, `can_`
  - expressions using `is_number(...)`, `has_value(...)`, comparisons, `and`, `or`, or `not`
- Do not flag literal string-state checks such as `states('sensor.x') == 'on'`.
- Do not flag real boolean comparisons or tests: `== true`, `== false`, `is true`, `is false`, `is sameas true`, `is sameas false`.
- Suggested fix:
  - use the boolean value directly (`{{ plan_inputs_valid }}`)
  - use direct negation for false checks (`{{ not plan_inputs_valid }}`)

## R-24 Evidence Boundary

- Apply only when both conditions hold:
  1. the variable name is capacity-like (`capacity`, `capacity_kwh`, `battery_capacity`, `maximum_energy`, `max_energy`, or close variants)
  2. the source entity or source expression contains `available_energy`
- Keep severity LOW and wording advisory. This is domain sanity checking, not a schema or syntax error.
- Do not assume a specific integration, manufacturer, or replacement entity. Suggest verification of maximum/nominal/capacity source only.

## R-19 Evidence Boundary

- Apply only to Jinja2 `if` / `elif` / `else` chains with at least one `elif`. Skip single `if` / `else` binaries.
- First confirm the `if` / `elif` guards are entity-state-style conditions:
  - direct `is_state(...)`
  - direct `states(...)`
  - or local variables clearly derived from those calls
- Then confirm the terminal `else` is a bare catch-all and contains a direct `trigger.id` comparison.
- Skip `trigger.id` checks that already live in an explicit `elif`.
- Skip non-entity-state selector trees such as mode, numeric-range, or time-range dispatch.
- Skip `else` bodies that add explicit extra state guards alongside the `trigger.id` comparison.
- Skip the preferred `choose` + `condition: trigger` routing pattern entirely.
- Keep the warning branch-structure-specific. Do not infer trigger intent from aliases, names, or external semantics.
- Preferred fixes:
  - move the `trigger.id` check into an explicit `elif`
  - or refactor to `choose` + `condition: trigger`

## R-21 Evidence Boundary

- Apply only when all three hold:
  1. two branches in one automation or script form a complementary forward/reverse pair acting on the same target state
  2. the forward branch writes a dedicated state flag (any helper type)
  3. the reverse branch contains no guard on that flag — neither a `condition:` entry nor a template check
- Skip when no capture flag exists at all — mixed write bases without a flag are R-17 territory, not R-21.
- Treat a guard on the saved snapshot itself (for example "only restore when the snapshot helper is not `unknown`") as an equivalent re-entry guard ONLY when the restore path also clears/resets that snapshot after restoring. A persistent snapshot that is never cleared can still hold a value from an earlier cycle, so the guard does not prevent stale restores — flag it.
- Skip pairs where the reverse action is idempotent and stateless (for example plain `light.turn_off` without restoring saved values) — the hazard is restoring stale captured state, not symmetric toggling.
- Never derive the pair from cross-automation analysis; both branches must live in one config item.

## R-22 Evidence Boundary

- Apply only when both hold:
  1. a trigger or branch explicitly handles HA startup (`trigger: homeassistant` with `event: start`, or a trigger id routed into a startup branch)
  2. that startup path reads state captured by a construct from the transient list in `skills/ha-nova/best-practices.md` → Persistence Model
- Without a startup trigger, transient snapshots are fine for short-lived save/restore cycles — do not flag them.
- `scene.create` alone is not a finding; the finding is the combination with a restart-recovery expectation.
- When the storage construct is ambiguous (for example a custom integration entity), ask instead of flagging.

## R-25 Evidence Boundary

- Apply only when reviewing pasted or draft YAML that contains a domain-level list item with `platform: template`, or a bare top-level list whose items carry `platform: template` — pasted contents of an `!include` file (for example `sensors.yaml`) have no wrapping domain key but define the same removed entities. Stored automations, scripts, and helpers read back from HA never carry this syntax — do not fetch or scan `configuration.yaml` to hunt for it.
- Bare-list items count only when they are entity-shaped, meaning any of:
  - the item carries a per-entity map: `sensors:`, `binary_sensors:`, `switches:`, `covers:`, `fans:`, `lights:`, `locks:`, `vacuums:`, or `panels:` (legacy alarm_control_panel)
  - the item carries legacy weather template fields directly (for example `condition_template:`, `temperature_template:`)
  - the user names an entity include (such as `sensors.yaml` or `weather.yaml`)
  A bare `- platform: template` item whose only template field is a direct `value_template:` (no per-entity map, no weather fields) is a legacy template trigger from a trigger include — that is M-05 territory, never R-25.
- Version-sensitive phrasing: fetch the HA version via `ha-nova relay core --method GET --path /api/config` only when this check actually fires (never as a routine per-review call), then phrase the finding accordingly:
  - HA >= 2026.6: removed — the entities are silently gone (keep HIGH).
  - HA 2025.12 to 2026.5: deprecated, still functional — downgrade the finding to MEDIUM and recommend migrating before upgrading.
  - HA < 2025.12: the syntax is still current on that version (deprecation started in 2025.12) — keep MEDIUM, do not call it deprecated; say it will stop working once the instance upgrades to 2026.6+ and recommend migrating ahead of that upgrade.
  - Version unavailable: state the outcomes conditionally.
- Do not confuse with the config-entry `template` helper domain (`ha-nova:helper`) or with `trigger: template` triggers — this check is only about `platform: template` entity definitions.
- When R-25 pulls a pasted template block into review scope, apply the template-level reliability checks (R-01, R-11, R-23) to its templates as well — those defects survive the migration to modern syntax.
- Migration hint shape (do not rewrite automatically; show the target shape):
  ```yaml
  template:
    - sensor:
        - name: "My Sensor"
          state: "{{ ... }}"
  ```

## R-26 Evidence Boundary

- Flag only when the stated or obvious intent is a CATEGORY and the comparison
  pins one literal that under-covers it. `== 'work'` for "when Markus is at
  work" is exactly right — never flag intent-matching literals.
- The criterion is under-coverage of the intent, not open vs closed state
  sets: two-state domains (binary_sensor on/off) and comparisons that cover
  the intended category exactly are fine.
- The classic instance: person/device_tracker away-semantics via
  `== 'not_home'` — any named zone (work, school, gym) silently fails the
  comparison although the person is away. Home-semantics via `== 'home'` is
  normally correct — only a user-defined zone placed inside the home radius
  can shadow it; do not flag it by default.
- This is a static check: it cannot prove which zones exist. Phrase it as "this
  comparison misses valid states like named zones" and show the category-safe
  form; never claim the automation is currently broken.

## R-29 Evidence Boundary

- Apply only when watchdog, self-healing, or continuous-monitoring
  CONTINUITY is declared by the user or promised by the config's own name or
  description. A recovery-shaped action alone (restart, reload, reconnect) is
  never that evidence — an intentionally one-shot recovery is its own valid
  class. Ordinary one-shot threshold automations are never flagged when no
  continuity promise exists.
- Name the incomplete design honestly a "one-shot recovery attempt", never a
  "watchdog"; report the gap and the persistent-fault options (bounded retry,
  periodic re-evaluation, failure escalation).
- Report only: never rewrite the automation and never execute its recovery
  actions to test liveness.

## R-30 Evidence Boundary

- Apply only to configs that already contain retry/recovery machinery; never
  suggest adding retries to ordinary service calls.
- An ambiguous transport failure never justifies another attempt — the first
  action may already have been applied. Flag retries keyed on it; do not flag
  their absence.
- No universal retry count, delay, or backoff exists: flag missing or
  unbounded values, never impose specific ones.
- Report only: never rewrite the workflow and never execute recovery actions.

## R-31 Evidence Boundary

- Evaluate one conjunction scope at a time: the root `conditions:` list or one
  explicit `condition: and` block.
- Collect only native `condition: state` checks with exact `entity_id` matches
  and fixed literal state values inside that scope.
- Flag only mutually exclusive requirements for the same entity, such as `on`
  and `off`. Skip numeric, template, device, and other condition types.
- Skip `condition: or` scopes and contradictions separated across different
  `choose` branches or other scopes that do not have to be true together.
- Recommend moving intentional alternatives under `condition: or` or retaining
  only the intended fixed state requirement.

## Performance (Medium)

- P-01: `trigger: template` trigger that could be a `trigger: state` trigger (see `skills/ha-nova/template-guidelines.md` → Decision Tree)
- P-02: `homeassistant.update_entity` inside a `repeat:` loop without meaningful delay
- P-03: Polling loop (`repeat: while:` + short `delay:`) instead of `wait_for_trigger`
- P-04 [MEDIUM → HIGH]: Template trigger using `now()` for time-sensitive logic — re-evaluates only once per minute; for sub-minute precision use `time_pattern` trigger or a dedicated sensor. Default MEDIUM. Escalate to HIGH only with concrete sub-minute precision needs (see P-04 Evidence Boundary).
- P-05 [LOW]: `trigger: device` with `device_id` where a `trigger: state` with `entity_id` would work — `device_id` is not persistent across device re-adds; exception: Zigbee2MQTT autodiscovered device triggers and ZHA button/remote events (see `skills/ha-nova/best-practices.md` → Zigbee Button Patterns)

## Style (Low)

- M-01: Missing `alias:`
- M-02: Deprecated `service:` key instead of `action:`
- M-03: `entity_id:` under `data:` instead of `target: entity_id:`
- M-04: *retired — moved to Reliability as R-20*
- M-05 [LOW]: Legacy automation syntax keys — `platform:` inside a trigger item (renamed to `trigger:` in HA 2024.10), or singular top-level `trigger:`/`condition:`/`action:` blocks (renamed to `triggers:`/`conditions:`/`actions:`). Both forms still work and auto-migrate when edited in the HA UI; this is a modernize advisory only. Mention it once per reviewed target (in bulk mode fold repeats into the Repeated Patterns section), never as an error, and never rewrite a config just to modernize the keys.

## Script-Specific (apply ONLY when domain is `script`, skip for automations)

- F-01 [HIGH]: `fields:` entry without `selector:` (UI shows raw text box for all types)
- F-02 [HIGH]: `fields:` with `required: true` or `default:` but no `| default(...)` guard in `variables:` block — `required` and `default` are UI-only, not enforced at runtime
- F-03 [MEDIUM]: Template `{{ field_name }}` in sequence without corresponding `variables:` guard — fails silently when caller omits field
- F-04 [MEDIUM]: `mode: queued` or `mode: parallel` without explicit `max:` value
- F-05 [HIGH]: `mode: parallel` with actions writing to same entity (race condition) — same hazard as R-08; severity raised for parity. Use `mode: queued` or sequence-level locks if parallel concurrency is required.
- F-06 [MEDIUM]: `action: script.turn_on` (non-blocking) when next step depends on result — use blocking `action: script.{id}` instead
- F-07 [LOW]: Script contains `wait_for_trigger:` at top of sequence with no preceding logic — likely should be an automation
- F-08 [LOW]: Hardcoded values that vary per call-site should be `fields:` parameters (human-judgment check — flag only obvious cases like repeated entity_ids or magic numbers)
- F-09 [LOW]: Orphaned script — not invoked by any automation, script, or scene (`search/related`; cleanup hint like H-07, never a runtime hazard). `search/related` does NOT index dashboards: either scan the storage dashboards for `script.*` card actions, or say dashboard usage cannot be ruled out

## Helper-Specific (apply when reviewing helpers or automations referencing helpers)

- H-01 [HIGH]: `input_number` without explicit `min`/`max` — HA defaults 0/100, likely wrong for physical quantities
- H-02 [MEDIUM]: `input_boolean`/`input_select` as condition guard without `homeassistant.started` initializer — state unknown after restart
- H-03 [MEDIUM]: `input_number` `mode: box` with wide range and no `step` — easy to mistype values
- H-04 [LOW]: `input_select` `initial` not set — defaults to first option, may not be intended
- H-05 [MEDIUM]: `counter` without `minimum`/`maximum` — unbounded growth risk
- H-06 [LOW]: `timer` without `duration` — must be set via service call before start
- H-07 [LOW]: Orphaned helper — not referenced by any automation/script (cleanup hint, not a runtime hazard; check via `search/related`; for cleanup workflow see `skills/ha-nova/safe-refactoring.md` → Orphan Cleanup)
- H-08 [LOW]: Naming inconsistency — mixed patterns across helpers (e.g., `sleep_mode` vs `Sleep Mode` vs `sleepMode`)
- H-09 [MEDIUM → HIGH]: Threshold effectively weakened — `input_number` is used as a direct threshold and its current value sits at or near the boundary that makes the guard trivially easy to satisfy. Operator-aware: `>`/`>=` is risky near `min`; `<`/`<=` is risky near `max`. "Near" means within `1 × step`, including the exact boundary. Escalate to HIGH only with concrete loop evidence (`repeat:`, or R-10/R-12 matched at HIGH also applies).
- H-10 [LOW]: Threshold value off the configured step grid — current `input_number` value does not land on the configured `step` lattice relative to `min`; likely set programmatically rather than through the UI. Supplementary signal for H-09, not a severity escalator by itself.
- H-11 [LOW]: Unit mismatch — a helper's `unit_of_measurement` disagrees with the unit the consuming template/automation treats it as; flag only when both units are actually visible in the workset
- H-12 [MEDIUM]: Config-entry helper source entity absent — `source`/`entity_id` of a `utility_meter`/`derivative`/`integration`/`min_max`/`threshold`/`statistics`/`history_stats` entry resolves in NEITHER the entity registry NOR `/api/states`
- H-13 [MEDIUM]: `group` helper with a dead or duplicate member entity
- H-14 [LOW]: `utility_meter` cycle/tariff disagrees with the energy-dashboard tariff configuration — only when the energy prefs are ALREADY loaded in this review; never fetch them just for this check
- H-15 [MEDIUM]: `template` config-entry helper renders `unavailable`/`unknown` because a referenced entity id resolves to nothing — pair the rendered-state read with an entity-id resolution before flagging

H-12/H-13/H-15 dead-source/member findings require absence from BOTH the
entity registry AND `/api/states` — YAML/manual entities live in states
without a registry record (same boundary as SC-01/D-01/HX).

## Scene-Specific (apply when reviewing storage scenes)

- SC-01 [HIGH]: Dead entity reference — a key under `entities:` resolves in NEITHER the entity registry NOR `/api/states`; the scene applies partially and silently
- SC-02 [MEDIUM]: Mixed color attributes on one light — more than one of `color_temp_kelvin`/`hs_color`/`rgb_color`/`xy_color`/`rgbw_color`/`rgbww_color` captured; reproduction depends on the active color mode and is unreliable
- SC-03 [MEDIUM]: Light group captured instead of member lights — group reproduce-state is a known trouble spot; suggest capturing the members
- SC-04 [LOW]: Read-only domain captured (`sensor`, `binary_sensor`, ...) — a scene cannot reproduce it
- SC-05 [LOW]: Measurement/diagnostic attribute captured (battery, rssi, ...) instead of writable target attributes
- SC-06 [MEDIUM]: Captured color attribute outside the entity's `supported_color_modes` — the device cannot reproduce it
- SC-07 [LOW]: Orphaned scene — no automation/script references it (`search/related`), no storage-dashboard card action calls it, and its state timestamp shows no recent activation; cleanup hint, never a defect

## SC Evidence Boundaries

- SC-01 requires absence from BOTH the entity registry AND `/api/states` — YAML-defined entities live in states without a registry entry, and an `unavailable` entity is offline, not deleted.
- SC-02/SC-06 need the live entity's `supported_color_modes`; never flag from the scene config alone.
- SC-07: `search/related` does not index dashboards. Scan card actions across ALL storage dashboards before emitting the hint; if the scan is incomplete or YAML-mode dashboards are present, say dashboard usage cannot be ruled out and skip the cleanup hint. Scene state `unknown` means "never activated", which strengthens the evidence but proves nothing broken.

## Dashboard-Specific (apply when reviewing storage dashboards)

- D-01 [HIGH]: Broken card entity reference — an `entity`/`entities[]` id absent from BOTH the registry AND `/api/states`; the card renders permanently unavailable
- D-02 [HIGH]: `custom:` card with no matching entry in `lovelace/resources` — the card cannot render at all
- D-03 [MEDIUM]: Duplicate view `path` within one dashboard — routing collision
- D-04 [LOW]: Empty view, or a view whose only card is broken
- D-05 [MEDIUM]: Orphaned Lovelace resource — no `custom:` card, custom dashboard/view strategy, or custom view type across the storage dashboards references it (cleanup hint; say that YAML-mode dashboards are invisible to this scan and cannot be ruled out)
- D-06 [LOW]: Card references a registry-disabled entity (`disabled_by` is non-null) — it does not produce a state, so the card stays unavailable
- D-07 [MEDIUM]: Built-in card missing its required field — authoritative minimal schema: `entity`/`tile`/`gauge`/`sensor` require `entity`; `entities`/`history-graph` require a non-empty `entities` list; `markdown` requires `content`; `button` has no required field. Judge ONLY these allowlisted types; never infer custom-card schemas

## D Evidence Boundaries

- D-01 requires absence from BOTH the registry AND `/api/states` (YAML/manual entities have states but no registry entry); D-06 requires non-null `disabled_by` on an entity that DOES have a registry entry — never flag `hidden_by` alone.
- All dashboard D/HX scans traverse the full dashboard object recursively. Follow nested `cards[]`, singular `card`, `elements[]`, `badges[]`, `sections[]`, and header-card structures; inspect every nested card `type`, entity reference, and `tap_action`/`hold_action`/`double_tap_action` service target before applying D-01, D-02, D-05, or HX-05. A top-level-only scan is invalid.
- D-02/D-05 join `lovelace/config` across ALL storage dashboards with `lovelace/resources` — scan card `type`, view `type`, and dashboard/view `strategy.type`; partial joins produce false orphans, so skip D-05 when not all dashboards were read.
- D-07 checks exactly the minimal schema spelled out in the rule — no field beyond the one listed is ever required, and `custom:` cards are never judged.

## Cross-Item (aggregate/bulk reviews with registry context)

- HX-01 [HIGH]: Automation/script action targets a `scene.*`/`script.*` entity that no longer exists
- HX-02 [HIGH]: Automation/script references an `input_*`/`counter`/`timer`/`schedule` helper absent from the registry
- HX-03 [MEDIUM]: `target.area_id`/`floor_id`/`label_id`/`device_id` no longer present in its registry
- HX-04 [MEDIUM]: Trigger/condition references a `zone.*`/`person.*` entity that was deleted
- HX-05 [LOW]: Dashboard card action calls a scene/script that no longer exists

## HX Evidence Boundaries

- HX fires only when the referenced item is confirmed ABSENT from its authoritative registry AND (for entity-shaped references) from `/api/states` — YAML-defined items have states without registry entries; a failed state read or `unavailable` is not deleted.
- Scope stays the review workset the user asked for; the registry lists may be read once to resolve references, but HX never expands the workset itself.

## Template/REST/Command-line Sensors (TS — YAML files)

Applied by `ha-nova:yaml-config` before writing sensor YAML; review applies them only when such YAML sits in the workset (pasted, or read through opt-in file access).

- TS-01 [HIGH]: Template references an entity id absent from both registry and states — the sensor goes silently `unavailable`
- TS-02 [HIGH]: `float`/`int` filter without `default` in a state/value template (the R-01 hazard; YAML sensor files never reach the automation reviewer)
- TS-03 [MEDIUM]: `rest`/`command_line` sensor without an `availability` template — a down source propagates `unknown` into consumers
- TS-04 [MEDIUM]: Aggressive `scan_interval` (sub-10 s) against a remote or expensive source
- TS-05 [HIGH]: `command_line` command interpolates a secret or an unvalidated template input (the S-01 hazard on a shell boundary)
- TS-06 [LOW]: `unit_of_measurement`/`device_class`/`state_class` combination inconsistent — breaks long-term statistics and energy
- TS-07 [MEDIUM]: Duplicate `unique_id` or duplicate sensor name across the template blocks of the file

## P-04 Evidence Boundary

`now()` in a template trigger is re-evaluated only when another tracked entity in the template changes, or once per minute as a fallback. For sub-minute precision the trigger is materially broken — it cannot fire at the resolution the surrounding logic implies.

- Default severity: **MEDIUM**. Suggested wording: *"This template trigger uses `now()`, which only re-evaluates when a tracked entity changes or once per minute. For sub-minute precision use a `time_pattern` trigger or a dedicated time sensor."*
- Escalate to **HIGH** with concrete sub-minute precision evidence:
  - A sibling `for:` or `timeout:` shorter than 60 seconds — the trigger cannot resolve before the deadline.
  - The template compares `now()` to a timestamp delta below 60 seconds (e.g., `(now() - states(...).last_changed).total_seconds() < 30`).
  - The automation gates safety/security actions (alarm arming, lock state, presence-based access) where minute-level drift is materially harmful.
  - The automation is a watchdog whose stated purpose (in `alias:`/`description:` or referenced helpers) is to detect stale data — once-per-minute evaluation can mask the very stalled-data condition the watchdog is designed to detect.
- Skip entirely when `time_pattern` or a dedicated time sensor (`sensor.time`, `sensor.date_time`) is already present in the same trigger block.
- Do not escalate purely on the presence of `now()`. The minute-cadence is acceptable for hour-/day-scale logic.

## Helper Threshold Evidence (for H-09/H-10)

- Apply only for direct threshold references, not broad heuristics:
  - `numeric_state` with helper-backed `above`/`below`
  - direct template comparisons where an explicit `input_number.<id>` appears in the compared expression
- Read live helper evidence via:
  - `ha-nova relay core --method GET --path /api/states/<helper_entity_id> --jq-file <state-filter-file> --out <state-file>`
  - Write `<state-filter-file>` with `if .ok then .data.body else empty end`
- Use `state` plus `attributes.min`, `attributes.max`, and `attributes.step`. If any of these are missing or non-numeric, skip H-09/H-10.
- For H-10, check the step lattice relative to `min`, not `value % step`. Use a small float tolerance when deciding whether `(value - min) / step` is effectively an integer.
- `choose:` alone is not enough for HIGH severity. Escalate only when the weakened threshold also participates in concrete loop-capable control flow (`repeat:` or already-matched R-10/R-12).
- Do not emit R-10 just because H-09 matched. Report R-10 only when its own queue-saturation criteria are independently satisfied.

## Known Safe Patterns (do NOT warn)

- Motion on → light on + No motion (with `for:`) → light off = complementary pair
- Goodnight routine → all off + Motion → specific light on = intentional override
- Sunrise → open + Sunset → close = mutually exclusive time windows
- Automation A and B target same entity but with non-overlapping value ranges (e.g., brightness 0-50 vs 51-100)

## Known Problem Patterns (DO warn)

- **Flip-Flop:** Automation A turns entity on (schedule/event), Automation B turns it off (timer/no-motion), triggers can overlap with no guard → entity bounces
- **Cascade:** Automation A changes entity X, entity X is template dependency, Automation B triggers on X → unintended chain reaction
- **Race Condition:** Two automations with `delay:` targeting same entity, both can fire before other's delay expires
- **Stale Helper:** `input_boolean` used as condition guard, no `homeassistant.started` initializer → wrong state after restart
- **Startup Flash:** Template sensor trigger without `unknown`/`unavailable` from_state guard → fires on HA restart
- **Self-Trigger Loop:** Automation triggers on entity X and sets entity X in actions → re-triggers itself; with `mode: queued`/`parallel` this creates infinite loop consuming queue slots until `max:` is hit (see also R-12)
