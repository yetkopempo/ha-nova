# Cloud Release Evidence Risk Scope

Status: active

## Problem

The Cloud release contract currently requires every positive path, rare
account state, operating system, and lifecycle failure to be repeated as one
real-device matrix for every evidence commit. Some states need external
accounts or subscriptions that a maintainer cannot safely manufacture. The
Cartesian matrix spends time without adding commit-specific confidence.

## Decision

Keep the existing evidence schema and fail-closed verifier. Split evidence
into two layers:

1. Exact-target checks always run: CI, security and recovery contracts,
   per-platform execution evidence — the candidate workflow's hash-bound
   native runner smoke on every enabled platform, plus the installed-layout
   provenance on the maintainer host and on every reachable lab host
   (maintainer decision 2026-08-28: an unreachable lab host may fall back —
   explicit per-run opt-in `HA_NOVA_EVIDENCE_RUNNER_FALLBACK=1` — to a
   positive local verification of the bundle's signed Cloud release
   evidence plus the runner smoke; only the installed-layout runtime
   execution is skipped, named in the ledger; a reachable host is never
   skipped) — and the exact installed Relay App. For deltas that match an invalidation-map row with
   real-platform scope, one real reference-platform Cloud health smoke also
   runs, using the downloaded candidate binary with Census suppressed —
   unless the reference-smoke waiver below applies.
2. Risk-scoped qualification runs on first support and after a relevant
   implementation or evidence-harness change. A passing qualification remains
   applicable across unrelated changes.

The check owner must inspect the complete qualification-to-target diff before
attesting carried evidence. The activation or release pull request records a
non-secret qualification ledger for every carried check and keyring OS:
qualified commit and tree, evidence reference, inspected target, and the
change-class decision. The privileged evidence secret remains the attestation;
the pull-request ledger makes its inputs reviewable without expanding the
existing JSON schema. The verifier validates the privileged attestation and
exact target; it does not infer the maintainer's invalidation decision. Missing
or uncertain ledger data means rerun.

Carry-forward applies only to the qualification behind a check boolean. The
JSON envelope, commit/tree identity, candidate provenance, and installed App
remain exact-target; the reference health smoke is exact-target for deltas
with real-platform scope, waivable only under the reference-smoke waiver
below. Never reuse an older JSON envelope, except through
the ancestor-bound `uses:`-only and non-sensitive source escapes (see the
escape section below and `docs/releasing.md`).
The verifier binds that new envelope to the exact target. Reviewers verify the
qualification ledger before the boolean is set to `true`.

## Invalidation map

Use the narrowest matching row. A change that matches multiple rows invalidates
their union. A qualification trigger includes changes to every deterministic
substitute and real evidence collection/validation harness it relies on.

### Reference-smoke waiver (2026-08-19)

When no validation infrastructure is available, the maintainer may waive the
real reference-platform Cloud health smoke and exactly those real-platform
qualification reruns that the delta's matched invalidation-map rows require.
Eligible infrastructure gaps are exactly these three: no reachable reference
platform; no completable human-gated Cloud authorization (no interactive
desktop session exists); or — for rows scoped "Affected OS only" — no
interactive desktop session on the affected OS, whose machine must still be
provenance-reachable, because a fully unreachable enabled platform already
fails the non-waivable provenance requirement.
Nothing outside those rows is waivable, and every deterministic exact-target
test still runs. Each waived check must itself be blocked by the named
unavailable infrastructure; a check that can still run, runs. A waiver is never implicit: the PR ledger must name the
unavailable infrastructure that makes the waiver eligible, the waived
checks, the last real qualification they carry from, the exact crossing
delta, and state that the maintainer accepts the residual risk. Four things
are never waivable: the JSON envelope, the commit/tree identity, the
per-platform execution evidence (the candidate workflow's native runner
smoke; installed-layout provenance on the maintainer host and reachable
lab hosts; opted-in fallback platforms get a positive local verification
of their signed bundle evidence), and the live `installed_relay_app`
check. None of the four requires the reference platform: the runner smokes
run in the candidate workflow itself, and `installed_relay_app`
is a live relay health read that may run from any host that reaches the
installed Relay App. The map rows' "one reference platform" scope governs
only the waivable qualification repeats — including the Relay-App row's —
never this live read, which is a separate, platform-independent, mandatory
proof. If even one of the four cannot be completed, there is
no waiver and the delta stays unmergeable. The remaining levers are then a
reviewed pull request that removes the unavailable platform from
`cloud_remote_platforms` — which relieves only that platform's candidate
provenance — or one that disables Cloud remote entirely; full disable is the
only lever when the envelope, the commit/tree identity, or the live
`installed_relay_app` read cannot be completed. Waived checks remain first in
line for a real rerun once infrastructure is available again: the backlog
rerun is then due before the next release tag, and while it is pending no
evidence session may set the affected check booleans without either running
it or recording in the ledger why it is still blocked.

| Changed surface | Qualification to repeat | Real platform scope |
|---|---|---|
| Cloud or Relay transport, Ingress session, endpoint, or route selection | `parity`, `stress_10000`, `routing`, relevant lifecycle and non-disclosure paths | One reference platform |
| Shared native-secret orchestration | `keyrings` | One reference platform, plus any OS with different behavior |
| macOS, Windows, or Linux native-store adapter | `keyrings`; relevant lifecycle path | Affected OS only |
| `internal-cloud-stress` or its evidence collection/validation harness | `stress_10000` | One reference platform |
| OAuth, Home Assistant user binding, or App discovery | `roles`, `domains_mfa`; relevant authorization lifecycle | One reference platform |
| Relay App startup, identity, device registry, or installation | `installed_relay_app`; relevant lifecycle and redirect paths | One reference platform |
| CLI setup, install, update, uninstall, signing identity, or authorization retention | `signing_and_update_matrix`; relevant lifecycle path | Affected OS only; exact provenance still runs on all enabled OSes |
| Config, argv, logs, diagnostics, or AI-visible output | `redirects_non_disclosure` | Affected surface; one retained real artifact scan |
| A deterministic substitute or real evidence collection/validation harness | Its owning qualification | Same scope as that qualification |
| Release workflow or provenance machinery only | `signing_and_update_matrix` | Exact provenance on all enabled OSes |
| Unrelated docs, tests, process, or product code | None | Exact-target layer only; see the non-sensitive source escape below |

## Non-sensitive source escape (added 2026-08-12)

The `None` row's exact-target requirement made every docs/skills pull
request cost one maintainer evidence session (measured on the 2026-08-09/10
audit train: one session per PR, twelve PRs). The verifier therefore accepts
a carried envelope when the complete ancestor-to-target delta is confined to
regular non-executable Markdown files under `docs/` or `skills/` or at the
repository root, none carrying an agent-policy basename (any basename whose
stem starts with `agent(s)`, `claude`, or `gemini` — suffix variants like
`AGENTS.override.md` included — at any depth, case-folded) — with one content
guard applied to every file in the delta (a guarded subcommand anywhere
after its command on the same line counts; no option grammar): no changed
line, nor a context line adjacent to a change, may touch these families —

- downloaders and pipe-to-shell invocations, including the PowerShell
  download and expression verbs;
- package-manager installs across language and OS ecosystems, and remote
  package runners that fetch before executing;
- inline interpreter execution, wrapped or encoded shell invocations, and
  version-pinned remote source builds;
- raw-script and CDN script sources;
- shell line continuations, where a trailing backtick counts only when
  unpaired, so balanced Markdown code spans and fences do not.

The families are named here on purpose and the concrete tokens live only in
`scripts/release/verify-cloud-nonsensitive-source.mjs`, which is the
authority: a spec that enumerated every verb would drift from the code, and
would trigger its own guard on every edit. Those lines are the copy-paste
surface users and agents
execute blindly; changing them keeps the full evidence path. The guard
forces textual diffs (`--text`, `--no-ext-diff`), scans every line after the first
hunk marker so header-shaped content cannot dodge it, requires
printable-ASCII paths, rejects control characters other than tab in changed
lines (UTF-16 or NUL padding cannot split command words), and fails closed
when a changed file yields no scannable delta — so in-tree diff attributes,
binary heuristics, or text/path encoding can never blind it. It stays
documented as best-effort: a denylist cannot be complete, and PR review
stays the semantic control.

Deliberate exclusions: `tests/**` stays outside the escape because
privileged release workflows execute repository tests with
production-environment secrets, so test content must remain attested.
Agent-policy basenames (stems `agent(s)`, `claude`, `gemini`, with any
suffix — `AGENTS.md`, `AGENTS.override.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`)
stay outside at every depth and in any case spelling — agents load them per
subtree, Codex prefers override variants, and
on a case-insensitive checkout an added `agents.md`/`claude.md` would
materialize as the executable policy of agents operating with maintainer
credentials (`CLAUDE.md` is additionally a symlink, rejected by mode).
Non-Markdown files (assets, dotfiles such as `.gitattributes`) stay
outside.

Residual risk, accepted deliberately: skill files instruct AI agents and are
protected under this escape by PR review, Codex, and the skill contract
tests instead of the privileged attestation — the envelope never verified
skill content, it sealed the tree. Enforced by
`scripts/release/verify-cloud-nonsensitive-source.mjs`, called by
`verify-cloud-release-gate.sh` after the `uses:`-only escape fails; mixed
deltas fail closed.

## Check contract

- `parity`: real `/health`, `/ws`, `/core`, `/files`, and `/backups` parity on
  one reference platform for every Cloud or Relay transport change.
- `stress_10000`: one real bounded run per Cloud or Relay transport change or
  stress-harness change, not once per operating system.
- `keyrings`: real happy-path and fail-closed no-UI behavior on every enabled
  OS for first support. A shared orchestration change repeats one reference OS;
  an adapter change repeats only its affected OS. Deterministic platform tests
  cover cancellation and timeout branches.
- `roles`: one real standard non-administrator binding on a reference
  platform. Exact-target tests verify that the authenticated Home Assistant
  user and Relay instance remain bound through setup and functional dispatch;
  Owner and administrator add no separate transport path.
- `domains_mfa`: one real canonical Nabu Casa OAuth flow. Home Assistant owns
  the MFA challenge before returning the same OAuth callback, so HA NOVA does
  not manufacture account-specific MFA proof. Deterministic tests cover
  custom-origin canonicalization, inactive subscription, disabled remote
  access, and authorization abort.
- `lifecycle`: one isolated Cloud-authorized profile first covers Relay App
  restart and reinstall recovery, then HA NOVA CLI standard uninstall/reinstall
  with retained authorization. Full purge is last; it revokes and verifies the
  active remote authorization and device before local cleanup. Deterministic
  crash/concurrency tests cover every durable boundary; update and
  instance-mismatch paths get a real run when those paths change.
- `redirects_non_disclosure`: exact-target redirect, argv, config, log,
  diagnostic, and AI-output tests plus one retained real artifact scan after
  a relevant transport, config, argv, log, diagnostics, or AI-output change.
- `installed_relay_app`: always exact-target. Supervisor builds the reviewed
  source, the App reports the expected version, and the reviewed Cloud routes
  exist.
- `routing`: one real automatic local-to-Cloud fallback after a routing
  change; exact-target tests cover every fail-closed non-fallback outcome.
- `signing_and_update_matrix`: always verify exact candidate signatures and
  provenance on all enabled platforms. Repeat real install/update behavior
  only after installer, updater, signing identity, or native authorization
  changes. Existing release rules still decide when an RC rehearsal is
  mandatory.

No mock may replace the required real positive path. No carried
qualification may cross a relevant implementation change, except those the
reference-smoke waiver covers, which records that crossing explicitly in the
ledger.

The exact-target Cloud health smoke is not `parity`. It repeats only for a
target whose delta matches an invalidation-map row with real-platform scope;
a maintenance delta (the `None` and release-machinery rows) refreshes the
envelope and provenance without a new smoke. When due, the official
downloaded candidate binary must run with `HA_NOVA_NO_CENSUS=1`
against the exact installed Relay App (from an isolated smoke profile — see
`docs/releasing.md` for the collision-safe setup):

```bash
HOME=<smoke-home> HA_NOVA_NO_CENSUS=1 <candidate-binary> relay health \
  --server <smoke-profile> --via cloud
```

The result must identify the expected App version and a healthy Home Assistant
WebSocket. Do not retain the private Cloud URL.

## Acceptance

- The JSON schema remains unchanged; the verifier's stale-evidence path was
  extended by the 2026-08-12 non-sensitive source escape.
- `docs/releasing.md`, `docs/reference/testing.md`, and the Cloud remote spec
  describe the same risk-scoped contract.
- Repository documentation checks pass.
- No product, workflow, version metadata, README, or tag changes; the
  release-gate verifier extension is the 2026-08-12 escape itself.
- The 2026-08-19 reference-smoke waiver changes only the maintainer
  contract; the verifier and gate code are untouched.
