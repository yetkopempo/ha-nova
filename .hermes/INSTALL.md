# Hermes Agent Install Overlay

> **Release status:** Hermes ships as early support (preview) and is listed in the public `README.md` as a **preview** client since v0.6.0. The Ubuntu/GNOME Keyring Linux route is maintainer-validated; validation for other Linux Secret Service backends, macOS native, and Windows WSL2 is experimental and tracked in [docs/reference/hermes-platform-validation.md](../docs/reference/hermes-platform-validation.md). Native Windows is not supported.

This page only covers Hermes-specific deltas.

For the stable installer, lifecycle commands, and general troubleshooting, use [README.md](../README.md) and the [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/markusleben/ha-nova/releases/latest).

## Setup Choice

- Desktop terminal path: run `ha-nova setup hermes`.
- Service, headless, SSH, systemd user service, or gateway path: run `ha-nova setup --service hermes`. It pairs exactly like the desktop path and keeps the device credential in a protected file — no unlocked desktop keyring needed.
- If you run `ha-nova setup hermes` and HA NOVA detects that the desktop keyring is locked or unavailable, setup asks whether to switch to the service/gateway token file.
- Install Hermes separately; HA NOVA handles the skills and onboarding, not the Hermes app itself.

## What Supported Means Here

Support status:
- `Supported` means HA NOVA intentionally supports that Hermes route and keeps install docs plus product behavior aligned to it.
- `Supported with limitation` means the route is real, but one UX slice is intentionally narrower today.
- `Not supported` means the route is outside the current HA NOVA support model.

Evidence status:
- `Maintainer-validated` means the maintainer ran that exact path on a real machine recently.
- `Community validation` is welcome and useful, but it is advisory only and does not replace maintainer release proof.
- `Planned / not yet validated` means the path is part of the intended support model, but the current release cycle does not claim a fresh maintainer proof yet.

## Platform Routing

Current support/evidence truth lives in [docs/reference/hermes-platform-validation.md](../docs/reference/hermes-platform-validation.md).

- macOS native Hermes follows the native macOS path.
- Linux native Hermes is the current focus for inline secure-storage recovery; GNOME Keyring is the actively maintainer-validated path.
- Linux non-GNOME Secret Service backends stay supported only when secure local storage already works; inline recovery is not claimed there yet.
- Windows native Hermes is not supported. Use WSL2 instead.
- Windows + WSL2 Hermes must run entirely inside the same WSL shell where `hermes --help` already works.

## Network Model

- Hermes is a local-first HA NOVA client, not a cloud-hosted control plane.
- The simple path today is to run Hermes on a machine you control with direct private reachability to Home Assistant and the HA NOVA Relay.
- In practice, that usually means the same home network or a private VPN/overlay route.
- A generic public VPS is not the intended beginner path today. It changes the trust and networking model, and it is not the current maintainer-validated Hermes story.
- On a supported native desktop session, the optional Home Assistant Cloud Beta can provide local-first remote fallback through `ha-nova cloud add`; this overlay's platform evidence limits still apply.
- Service, headless, SSH, WSL2, and generic VPS sessions stay local-only. Use a private VPN or overlay when they need remote reachability.
- Do not expose the HA NOVA Relay directly to the public internet.

## Linux Notes

- On Linux desktop sessions, HA NOVA uses the OS Secret Service / keyring for secure local token storage.
- For Hermes sessions that run without an unlocked desktop keyring, use `ha-nova setup --service hermes`. This stores only HA NOVA's local credential — the paired device credential (or, on standalone/legacy setups, the Relay Auth Token) — in a protected file under `~/.config/ha-nova/` with strict local file permissions.
- If HA NOVA asks for a local Linux keyring password, it stays on this machine. HA NOVA only uses it to unlock or create local secure storage. It is not your Relay token, not your Home Assistant token, and it is not sent to the Relay, Home Assistant, Hermes, or any AI provider.
- If no Secret Service provider is running, setup fails early with an explicit prerequisite message instead of raw `org.freedesktop.secrets` D-Bus errors.
- If Linux is using GNOME Keyring and the default collection is locked or uninitialized, `ha-nova setup hermes` can guide recovery inline.
- If the keyring exists but is never unlocked on this machine (headless VM, autologin box, systemd user service — nobody ever types a login password), do not chase per-boot unlocking: run `ha-nova setup --service hermes`, or `ha-nova pair --credential-store=file`.
- If Linux uses another Secret Service backend, keep the backend working first; HA NOVA does not pretend inline GNOME-only recovery exists there.
- If you run setup or repair over SSH and want desktop keyring storage, use the same logged-in desktop user session that owns the user D-Bus / Secret Service session. If that is not available, use the service path instead.

## Updates and Repair

- Run `ha-nova doctor` first. If Hermes is configured but not attached, doctor points you to `ha-nova setup hermes`.
- Connect or repair with `ha-nova setup hermes`.
- Repair service or gateway credentials with `ha-nova setup --service hermes`.
- `ha-nova setup hermes` also repairs older Hermes installs whose bare sub-skill directory names could make `skills_list` and `skill_view` disagree.
- On Windows with WSL2, run update and repair commands from the same WSL shell where Hermes is installed.
- Validate the current route and proof status in [docs/reference/hermes-platform-validation.md](../docs/reference/hermes-platform-validation.md).
- Validate the install with `ha-nova doctor`.
- Before the first Home Assistant task, the first HA NOVA skill used runs one quiet update check for both HA NOVA and the NOVA Relay App. Relay calls keep a cache-only nudge as fallback; silence only that fallback with `HA_NOVA_NO_UPDATE_NUDGE=1`. `ha-nova check-update` still works manually.
- After `ha-nova update` succeeds, start a new AI client session to load the updated HA NOVA skills.

## Hermes-Specific Skill Layout

- HA NOVA installs Hermes skills under `~/.hermes/skills/ha-nova/`.
- The context skill stays `ha-nova`.
- Hermes sub-skills are installed in matching namespaced directories such as `~/.hermes/skills/ha-nova/ha-nova-read/` and `~/.hermes/skills/ha-nova/ha-nova-review/`.
- Each Hermes sub-skill keeps the same canonical identifier for both directory name and frontmatter `name:` to keep `skills_list` and `skill_view` aligned.

## What You Get

After setup, HA NOVA skills are available inside Hermes with the HA NOVA namespaced skill set.

## Community Validation

- If you validate Hermes on another macOS build, Linux distro, desktop session, or Secret Service backend, open the Hermes platform validation issue template and redact all tokens and secrets.
- Community validation helps us expand the matrix faster, but maintainer-validated rows stay the release signoff source of truth.
